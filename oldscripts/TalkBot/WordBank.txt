In May of that year,The Daily Dotwrote that a shitpost is "a deliberate provocation designed for maximum impact with minimum effort".[7]In September 2016 the pro-Donald TrumpgroupNimble Americareceived widespread media attention.[8][9][10]The Daily Beastdescribed the group as "dedicated to \'shitposting\' and circulatinginternet memesmaligningHillary Clinton".[8]In September 2016The Independentwrote that shitposting is anapolitical"tool that can be put to a variety of effects".[11]However, posts such as these have appeared long before the2016 US presidential election.Engineering &amp; Technologymagazine wrote that "[s]hitposting, whether from the left or right, is perilously close to delivering an onlinemetastasisof Orwell\'sTwo-minute Hate[sic]".[12]In November 2016,Esquiremagazine wrote that "Internet mockery was emerging as a legitimate political technique: shitposting. Maybe the 2020 election would be all shitposting."[13]In March 2018, talking aboutFacebookgroupNew UrbanistShitposting orNew Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens,Chicagomagazine defined it as "posts that are meant to be awkward and irrelevant, aggravating and distracting social media communities from discussing their topic at hand".[14][15]Writing inPolygon, Sam Greszes compared shitposting to Dadaism\'s "confusing, context-free pieces that,specificallybecause they were so absurd, were seen as revolutionary works both artistically and politically".

Byrd had severed ties with the Ku Klux Klan in 1952.[20]On June 12, 2016, the day of the2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, moderators of the r/news subreddit began to remove many comments from its megathread pertaining to the shooting, leading to accusations ofcensorship.[22]On that day, r/The_Donald was featured in 13 of the top 25 posts on r/all, and gained over 16,000 subscribers during the weekend of the shooting. Meanwhile, r/news lost more than 85,000 subscribers.[23][unreliable source?]Due to deliberate[24][25][26]manipulation by the forum\'s moderators and active users, the algorithm that dictated what content reached the r/all page of Reddit resulted in a significant portion of the page being r/The_Donald content. In response,Redditadministratorsmade changes to its algorithms on June 15, 2016, in an attempt to preserve the variety of r/all.[27][14]In April 2016, u/jcm267, the founder of the subreddit, attributed the popularity of the subreddit to moderator u/CisWhiteMaelstrom. u/jcm267 toldMSNBCthat u/CisWhiteMaelstrom told him "we\'d have hundreds of thousands of readers there and I was very skeptical about that, not because I thought Trump can\'t win, because I think he\'s the only GOPer with \'landslide victory\' potential, but because Reddit is not a conservative place."[28]Subsequently, u/CisWhiteMaelstrom deleted his Reddit account.[27]In November 2016, Reddit CEOSteve Huffmanreported that the subreddit\'s moderator team had changed "at least four times" due to the community revolting.[12]The subreddit has hosted "Ask Me Anythings" (AMAs) of notable right-wing, conservative figures supportive of Trump includingScott Adams,Ann Coulter,Alex Jones,Helmut Norpoth,Curt Schilling,Peter Schweizer,Roger Stone,Milo Yiannopoulos,[29]Tucker Carlson,[30]andCorey Stewart.[31]Furthermore, Trump himself hosted an AMA on the subreddit on July 27, 2016,[32][33]which became one of r/The_Donald\'s most upvoted posts.[34]In September 2016,Palmer Luckey, the founder ofOculus VR, introduced a501(c)(4)organization on r/The_Donald called "Nimble America" with the stated purpose of creating and spreading pro-TrumpInternet memesthrough "Facebook ads, billboards, and \'website ops.\'"[35]Luckey stated that he had donated $10,000 to the organization and offered to match contributions from r/The_Donald users for 48 hours after the announcement.[36]Luckey later apologized for any negative impact his actions had on public perception of Oculus, and stated that he acted independently, not as a representative ofOculus VR.[37]The subreddit was also noted for investigating Clinton\'s leaked emails after their release byWikiLeaks.[12][38]Their findings were subsequently reported by right-wing news media[39]while WikiLeaks acknowledged the subreddit in a tweet.[40]The subreddit also coordinated to vote on many online polls during the2016 presidential debates.[4]The subreddit frequently attempted to manipulateAmazon.com\'s booklist viavote brigading, or encouraging subscribers to cast a certain review en masse. In November 2016, the subreddit was reportedly mobilizing readers to leave one-star reviews onAmazon.comforFox NewsanchorMegyn Kelly\'s autobiography,Settle for More, in response to what users considered biased reporting from her.[41]Amazon later removed many of the negative reviews.[42]Later, in September 2017, the subreddit attempted to buy copies of Trump\'sGreat Again: How To Fix Our Crippled Americato outsell Hillary Clinton\'s then-upcoming bookWhat Happened. However, their plan backfired when several users bought other Trump books instead such asTrump: The Art of the Dealwhile Clinton\'s book reached #1 on the site.[43]The subreddit also spread a rumor that Clinton\'s book was actually the best-selling "contemporary women fiction" book.[44]On November 22, 2016, the moderators of r/The_Donald announced that they were going to start removing posts about some conspiracy theories, such as the debunked[45][46][6]Pizzagate conspiracy theoryand a rumor thatJulian Assangehad disappeared, citing that such content was "drowning out thoughtful discussion or Trump-related content."[6]The next day, Steve Huffman admitted to editing the comments of r/The_Donald users by replacing his username (u/spez) within their comments insulting him with the usernames of r/The_Donald moderators instead.[47]Huffman said of the change that "I had my fun with them, they had their fun with me, but we are not going to tolerate harassment for any others."[47]One week later, Huffman apologized for his actions, and offered a filter feature to the website, allowing users to exclude subreddits from their r/all page.[48]Starting in February 2017, the subreddit was notably excluded from Reddit\'s updated homepage, r/popular, along with other "narrowly-focused politically-related subreddits."[49][50][51]In the beginning of January 2017, afterBuzzFeedpublished a35-page documentalleged to be a dossier of controversial but unverified information about then\xe2\x80\x93president-electTrump,[52]members of the subreddit stated that the document was "fan fiction" sent to Republican political strategistRick Wilsonby members of the4chanforum/pol/.[53]On January 11, 2017, Wilson denied the claims.[54]Later that day, Republican senatorJohn McCainconfirmed that he had sent the dossier to FBI directorJames Comeyseveral months earlier.[55]On May 18, 2017, a moderator named u/OhSnapYouGotServed posted a message claiming that the subreddit has been treated unfairly and that Reddit could not exist without r/The_Donald. u/OhSnapYouGotServed also suggested that all of their subscribers should move toVoat.[56]The next day, after three other moderators were banned from the site, the subreddit was temporarily set to "private" in a sign of protest. According to the lock message, the admins did not warn the three moderators before banning them.[57]The moderators stated that they "refused to comply by a special set of rules that were solely imposed on this subreddit to marginalize the only community which doesn\'t conform to the echo chamber of Reddit and corporate media." The subreddit was made public again the next day.[56]In July 2017, it was discovered that a congressional staffer for CongressmanMatt Gaetz(R-FL) asked for users on r/The_Donald to crowdsource information for a congressional amendment that would look into alleged misconduct on the parts of Hillary Clinton and James Comey. Gaetz confirmed the user was a staffer in an interview withWired, stating that "it is the responsibility of our staff to gather as much information as possible when researching a subject and provide that information for consideration. We pride ourselves on seeking as much citizen input as possible."[58]In January 2018, formerSenior CounselorSteve Bannon\'s statements regarding Trump were published inMichael Wolff\'s "Fire and Fury". After Trump himself criticized Bannon\'s comments, many individuals on the subreddit turned against Bannon. The negative comments were subsequently covered byVanity FairandIndependent Journal Review.[59][60]After theChristchurch mosque shootingsin March 2019, users of r/The_Donald posted messages to the subreddit that justified the shooting and violence against Muslims. When asked for comment, a Reddit spokesperson stated that Reddit had strengthened its hate speech and violence policies over the last several years.[61]When asked about users from r/The_Donald posting in the r/newzealand subreddit after the attack, the moderators of r/newzealand noted that the users often employdog-whistleverbiage, making it difficult to discern which content posted should have action taken against it.[62]Members of the subreddit maintained aDiscordserver called "Centipede Central", which peaked at 16,000 active users[63][64]and was among the largest servers on Discord.[65]The server was criticized for leaking personal information of anti-Trump activists,[64][66]which caused The_Donald to sever ties with the group. The server was eventually shut down in a coup in October 2017, which scattered its members to smaller communities.[63]On June 26, 2019, the subreddit was quarantined by Reddit admins due to excessive reports, threatening public figures associated with the2019 Oregon Senate Republican walkouts, and an over-reliance on the site admins to personally moderate the subreddit.[9][67]The quarantine adds a warning portal, removes revenue opportunity, removes the subreddit from feeds and search, and removes custom CSS styling.[1][9][7]Relationship to Trump[edit]The Trump campaign\'s digital director,Brad Parscale, stated in June 2016 that he visits the subreddit daily.[68]Throughout the election, members in Trump\'swar roomatTrump Towermonitored the subreddit to see new trends.[16][69]During the2016 Democratic National Conventionon July 27, 2016, Trump hosted an AMA on the subreddit.[32]Moderators of the subreddit stated that they banned more than 2,000 accounts during Trump\'s AMA session.[70]Trump also posted several pre-debate messages on the subreddit.[71][72]Throughout Trump\'s 2016 campaign, as well as the beginning of Trump\'s presidency, journalists noted that several of Trump\'s tweets contained images that originally appeared on the subreddit.[73]On July 6, 2016, in response to his deleted tweet containing theStar of David, Trump accusedDisneyof antisemitism on Twitter, which was accompanied with a photo of a sticker book based on the Disney filmFrozen. Justin Miller ofThe Daily Beastnoted that the image Trump used in his tweet originated on the subreddit less than 24 hours before.[14][74]Similarly, on March 3, 2017, Trump tweeted an image ofChuck Schumerposing withVladimir Putinto allege hypocrisy. According toBuzzFeed, the image was posted less than 24 hours earlier on the subreddit.[75]On May 11, 2017, after firingJames Comey, Trump responded toRosie O\'Donnell\'s 2016 tweet calling Comey to be fired with "We finally agree on something Rosie." Brandon Wall, a reporter forBuzzfeed, alleged that Trump browsed r/The_Donald because O\'Donnell\'s tweet was posted on the subreddit 20 minutes before Trump\'s response.[76][77][78]AlthoughThe Washington Postacknowledged that Trump tweeted images previously viral on the subreddit, they also noted that O\'Donnell\'s tweet did not go viral until Trump responded.[69]In July 2017, a video tweeted out by Trump was noted to have appeared on the subreddit about four days earlier.[79]However, the White House denied that the video directly came from Reddit.[80]In May 2019,Politicoreported that Trump\'s social media manager,Dan Scavino, frequented the subreddit, writing that he "has helped craft some of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s most memorable social media moments."[81]Influence[edit]A quantitative analysis found that r/The_Donald is an important influencer of news content on Twitter, with the board contributing 2.97% of mainstream news links and 2.72% of alternative news links on Twitter (as a fraction of all links co-appearing on Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan). The researchers concluded that "\'fringe\' communities often succeed in spreading alternative news to mainstream social networks."[82]They also calculated that r/The_Donald hosted 35.37% of URLs from 54 alternative news sites "like Infowars" on Reddit.[82]Prominence on Reddit website[edit]Algorithm[edit]Through the use of "sticky posts," a moderation function of Reddit that allows selected posts to be artificially placed at the top of a subreddit, the moderators of the forum were "gaming" the algorithms[83][84]in order to dominate the content on the r/all page, which is a representation of the most popular content on the website.[3]Additionally, users are often apt to flood the website with waves of identical images or posts, a direct violation of site-wide policies regarding spam. In response, Huffman rolled out a change to the r/all algorithm; he noted that r/The_Donald was among several Reddit communities over the years that "attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else."[27][14][85]Ongoing problems with members of the subreddit brigading and harassing other subreddits forced Reddit staff to modify the site\'s software algorithms to limit the offending posts to the subreddit. The Reddit team introduced r/popular to replace r/all, which included most popular subreddits except for The_Donald, and as a result the subreddit could no longer reach the front page.[86][87]In February 2017, Reddit overhauled their algorithms even further to prevent content from the subreddit (among other communities) from ever being seen by logged out users or people who do not have a Reddit account.[49]In a 2018 study byUniversity College London, r/The_Donald was the most active subreddit when it comes to posting memes. The study explained that "Reddit users are more interested in politics-related memes than other type of memes."[88]Conflict with Reddit management[edit]The subreddit received additional coverage on November 24, 2016, when Huffman admitted to editing r/The_Donald users\' comments that were critical of him, in response to harassment[89]by the community.[90][91][92]On November 30, 2016, Huffman announced thatsticky threadsfrom r/The_Donald would no longer show up on r/all.[8]Huffman\'s rules were criticized by some Redditors, including both Trump and non-Trump supporters,[47]while others felt the sanctions did not go far enough and called upon Huffman to ban the subreddit entirely.[3]While members of the subreddit claimed they were the victims of censorship, Huffman said the actions were about "banning behavior, not ideas."[3]The harassment directed at Huffman by r/The_Donald users led to changes in the manner in which Reddit deals with problematic communities and users. Since being harassed by the community, Huffman stated that Reddit is going to start actively policing problematic users: "We\'re taking a different strategy now. We are focusing more on, like, taking care of the individual users instead of doing it at the community level which was largely our strategy before."[93]In March 2017, users of r/The_Donald accused Reddit of discriminating against them when Reddit\'s advertising platform portrayed r/The_Donald as having 6,000,000 subscribers instead of the 385,000 displayed on the subreddit live counter available to the public.[94]The Reddit Director of Communications stated that the subscriber discrepancy was a simple labeling error wherein the count for "daily unique visitors" was mistakenly labeled as "subscribers" and that the error would be partially fixed by the end of the day.In May 2019, former Reddit CEOEllen PaotoldMother Jonesthat the subreddit should be banned for not following the site\'s rules. However, she also acknowledged that "it\'s hard to take down a subreddit which is driving a lot of traffic."[95]Controversies[edit]Pizzagate conspiracy theory[edit]Main article:Pizzagate conspiracy theoryA conspiracy theory involving theDemocratic Party,Hillary Clinton,John Podestaand theComet Ping Pongpizzeria attracted attention on r/The_Donald. Several members of the community created ther/pizzagatesubreddit which was subsequently banned by Reddit administrators for breaking site rules regarding sharing personal information of others.[96][97]In December 2016, the subreddit gained media attention when it linked a knee injury sustained by NBA playerAndrew Bogutto the conspiracy theory.[98]Seth Rich murder[edit]Further information:Murder of Seth RichThis sectionneeds expansion.You can help byadding to it.(July 2017)r/The_Donald has devoted a significant number of posts to themurder of Seth Rich,[15][99]with several members having planned a march onWashington D.C..[100]In July 2017,The Economistnoted that there had been over 10,000 posts dedicated to the topic.[15]CNN wrestling video[edit]Further information:CNN controversies \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa0Redditor controversyOn July 2, 2017, Donald Trump tweeted a video of himself wrestlingVince McMahonwith theCNNlogo superimposed over McMahon\'s face. Various sources, including theNew York Times, NBC News, BBC, andTheWashington Post, noted that the clip appeared on the subreddit about four days earlier.[79][101][102][103]However, on July 3, the White House denied that the video directly came from Reddit.[80]The Washington Postalso noted that the Reddit user who posted the video, u/HanAssholeSolo, also wrote about stabbing Muslims[104]whileVoxadded that the poster attempted to remove his racist comments, including many that said the wordniggerand an image ofJewishCNN employees, each being labeled with aStar of David, in a post titled "Something strange about CNN...can\'t quite put my finger on it."[2][105]Meanwhile, theAnti-Defamation Leaguereferred to the user as an "extremist" after analyzing his posts.[106]The ADL also identified the user as "a parent and a veteran in his 40s living in Tennessee" based on the personal information within his post history.[107]Based on the aforementioned posts, Vox reported that some members of the forum have interpreted the tweet as support for their racist beliefs.[2]Eventually, after being identified by CNN\'sAndrew Kaczynski, the user posted an apology in the subreddit on July 4.[108]Immediately afterwards, his apology was locked and deleted by the subreddit\'s moderators[108][109][110]while the user deleted his Reddit account.[111][112]CNN was accused byJulian Assange,Jack Posobiec, andMark Diceof blackmailing the user, while the hashtag, #CNNBlackmail, trended onTwitter.[113]Kaczynski responded by stating that his line was "misinterpreted" and that the user said that he was not threatened prior to his apology.[114]In response to the controversy, u/ShadowMan3001, one of the moderators of the subreddit, toldKevin RooseofThe New York Timesthat CNN\'s intent in possibly releasing the user\'s identity was "a glaring example of their absolute lack of not only journalistic integrity, but basic morality."[115]Russian propaganda[edit]In February 2018Inquisitrreported on an analysis that revealed that r/The_Donald had thousands of posts to it that originated from Russian propagandists, making it one of the biggest hubs of Russian-based propaganda on the internet.[116]Soon after,The Daily Beastobtained documents from the Russian-backed online "troll farm"Internet Research Agencythat confirmed that the organization deployed its agitators on subreddits including r/The_Donald and r/HillaryForPrison in the run-up to the 2016 election.[117]In early March 2018 congressional investigators revealed that they plan to question Reddit andTumblras part of their investigation into the Russian interference surrounding the 2016 U.S. presidential election with RepresentativeAdam Schiffurging Reddit and other major online platforms to make more data available about the extent of Russia\'s online propaganda efforts.[118]Huffman later admitted that Reddit was aware that the site was a target of Russian propagandists, and users of the website criticized Reddit for concealing Russian activity on the website and for not working fast enough to ban extremist communities.[119]When asked why the r/The_Donald community was not banned from the website, Huffman replied that "Banning them probably won\'t accomplish what you want. However, letting them fall apart from their own dysfunction probably will."Islamophobia[edit]Main article:Remove KebabThe slogan "Remove Kebab" has appeared on r/The_Donald in threads that have calls for violence and open hatred directed toward Muslims.[120]As a meme "Remove Kebab", based on the music video called "Serbia Strong" by a group of soldiers celebrating the Bosnian Serb war criminalRadovan Karad\xc5\xbei\xc4\x87has appeared in over 800 threads on the r/The_Donald.[120]The band\'s accordion playerNovislav \xc4\x90aji\xc4\x87, convicted in 1997 of crimes during theYugoslav wars, features in meme images and is known as "Dat Face Soldier".[120]Similar subreddits[edit]In response to the popularity of r/The_Donald, similar subreddits regarding other politicians have been created.[121]r/AskTrumpSupporters[edit]r/AskTrumpSupporters is a subreddit wherein Trump supporters would answer questions from non-Trump supporters.[122]Although the subreddit was created by moderators of r/The_Donald, r/AskTrumpSupporters eventually broke off from r/The_Donald and revamped its rules. According to one moderator, the goal of the subreddit is to "[not] promote anecho chamber, but to combat misconceptions by media and 80 percent of Reddit." However, the community has been accused by users of r/The_Donald of being "CTR" or "Shareblue" "shills" as its users often have political viewpoints perceived by r/The_Donald as "leftist." Despite this, the subreddit was part of a pro-Trump network that included r/The_Donald and r/AskThe_Donald.[123]The subreddit also compiled a list of questions for Trump during his AMA in 2016. r/AskTrumpSupporters was replaced by r/AskThe_Donald, which shared the same moderation team.[124]r/AskThe_Donald is a similar subreddit wherein supporters and non-supporters of Trump can ask Trump supporters and "vetted non-supporters" various political questions, primarily pertaining to the presidency of Trump.r/The_Schulz[edit]r/The_Schulz is a semi-serious subreddit created for theGermanpoliticianMartin Schulz, the formerpresident of the European Parliamentand a member of theSPD. According toSpiegel Online, r/The_Schulz was created as a satire against r/The_Donald.[125]Like r/The_Donald, the subreddit frequently uses slang terms, most notably "MEGA," or "Make Europe Great Again,"[125][126][127]and "keine bremsen" (German for "no brakes").[127]Since its creation in November 2016, the subreddit has been featured in many articles, both inside and outside ofGermany.[127][128][129]On January 30, 2017, Schulz gave the subreddit a shout-out on hisYouTubechannel.[126][130]As of January\xc2\xa02017[update], r/The_Schulz has over 10,000 subscribers.[126]Others[edit]Other notable subreddits include r/Le_Pen (for theFrenchNational FrontleaderMarine Le Pen),[128][131][132][133]r/The_Farage (for formerBritishUKIPleaderNigel Farage),[134][128]and r/The_Hofer (forAustrianpoliticianNorbert Hofer).[132]There were also anti-Trump subreddits that were created in response to the subreddit, most notably r/EnoughTrumpSpam.[27][14][135][136]While changing the r/all algorithm for r/The_Donald, Huffman noted that "r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That\'s Reddit for you."[14]Along with r/The_Donald, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was also excluded from r/popular.[49][51]Meanwhile, r/TrumpCriticizesTrump is a subreddit dedicated to pointing out Trump\'s alleged contradictions through his older tweets, press releases, and speeches.[137][138]Other notable anti-Trump subreddits include r/MarchAgainstTrump,[50][139]r/esist,[39][139][140]and r/The_Mueller.[141]In May 2018, another pro-Trump subreddit\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x93 r/thedonald[a]\xe2\x80\x93 was taken over by fans of actorDonald Glover, especially after a post featuring Glover accumulated over 45,000 upvotes. Prior to the take over, r/thedonald\'s moderator abandoned the subreddit and later set it to private.[143][144]Other figures featured on the subreddit includeDonald Duck,Donald Sutherland, andRonald McDonald.[145][146]Media reception[edit]This articlecontainstoo many or overly lengthy quotationsfor an encyclopedic entry.Pleasehelp improve the articleby presenting facts as aneutrally-wordedsummary withappropriate citations. Consider transferring direct quotations toWikiquote.(June 2019)The subreddit was criticized byVice, which stated in an article that the subreddit was "authoritarian," "racist," "misogynistic," "homophobic," "Islamophobic," and a "hypocritical \'free speech\' rallying point."[14]The publicationSlatedescribed r/The_Donald as a "hate speechforum"[147]andThe Vergehas described it as a "notoriously fetidtrollswamp."[148]According toThe New York Times, "[m]embers respond to accusations of bigotry with defiant claims of persecution at the hands of critics. It is an article of faith among posters that anti-racists are the real bigots, feminists are the actual sexists, and progressive politics are, in effect, regressive."[29]The subreddit was also criticized[by whom?]for spreadingfake newspromotingconspiracy theories[6][47]such as "Pizzagate."[90]In February 2017,Atlantic Council\'s Digital Forensic Research Lab analyzed how the subreddit was able to spread fake news throughout similar subreddits and conspiracy sites.[121]The subreddit is also connected to thealt-right[2][149][150][151]while an article byThe Washington Postconnected the moderators of closely related Trump subreddits to racist subreddits such as "r/Quranimals" and "r/Rapefugees."[134]One moderator banned users for reporting Islamophobia to the subreddit, saying, "Jesus Christ people, stop reporting Islamophobia. We don\'t fucking care about our \'Islamophobia problem\' AT ALL!"[4][14][152]The National Memonoted that "moderators have made the occasional attempt to rid r/The_Donald of overt racism and anti-Semitism"[153]andThe Economistemphasized that the moderators "at least try" to remove anti-semitism from the subreddit.[15]Meanwhile,Motherboardinterviewed a moderator of the subreddit, who said "[t]he people from /pol/ who can behave, which is probably most of them, stay. The people who don\'t behave usually wind up getting banned for rule 3."[14]The New York Timesalso noted that, in addition to the subreddit\'s "no racism/anti-Semitism" policy, the subreddit also warns against "dissenters or SJWs" posting on there and that "concern trolling" is also banned.[12]Gizmodocommented that the subreddit "revealed how easy the site\'s ageing algorithm is to game," comparing their actions to the profitability of fake news posted onFacebook.[154]Gizmodoalso referred the subreddit as "Trump supporters\' de facto base of power on Reddit."[155]Politicodescribed the subreddit as "a message board that acted as a conduit between 4chan and the mainstream Web."[16]In February 2017, afterKellyanne Conwaybrought up the falseBowling Green massacre,SFGatenoted that the subreddit\'s response to the incident was "varied \xe2\x80\x93 and rather muted." Some users shared the video uncritically while others thought that the incident was an intentional part of a larger strategy by the Trump administration.[156]Similarly, in May 2017, users on the subreddit began reposting memes pertaining to themurder of Seth Richthat occurred inWashington D.C..[99]Mashabledescribed the postings as a distraction since the users began posting just hours after "The Washington Postbroke the news that Trump had divulged classified intelligence to Russian representatives."[157]It was later reported byGizmodothat, at one point, 20 of the top 26 posts on the subreddit pertained to the Seth Rich murder.[155]In the aftermath of the2017 Las Vegas shooting, members of the subreddit initially thought that the suspect in the incident wasMuslimand wrote comments about banning Muslims and refugees. However, after the identity of the shooter was revealed, the members saw the shooting as a "false flag" and posted various conspiracy theories.[158][159]Usinglatent semantic analysis,FiveThirtyEightanalyzed the relationship between the r/The_Donald and 50,323 other active subreddits based on 1.4 billion comments made over a two-year period from 2015 to 2016, and found the community was related to a number of "hate-based subreddits," such as the respectively bannedr/fatpeoplehateandr/coontown.[38]See also[edit]Controversial Reddit communitiesDonald Trump on social mediaSocial media in the 2016 United States presidential electionTrump\'s Troll Army[fr]Notes[edit]^Not a typo; r/thedonald lacks theunderscorethat r/The_Donald has.[142]References[edit]^abcHaskins, Caroline."Reddit Quarantined r/The_Donald for \'Threats of Violence\'".VICE.

Are Reddit\xe2\x80\x99s Whiniest, Most Low-Key Toxic SubredditsReddit is full of shitty people. Here\'s where most of them hang out.byJustin CaffierSep 11 2017, 11:02pmShareTweetFlags via Wikimedia commons. Background screencap and Snoo via Reddit.It should come as little surprise that Reddit, the mega-popular message board and self-declared "front page of the Internet," is now thefourth most popular website in the US, beat only by Google, YouTube, and Facebook. It\'s become aperfunctory press tour stopfor celebrities and politicians, played a critical role inhistoricalpolitical events, and, much to the dismay of the site\'s top brass, has also turned into a hotbed of hatred and bigotry.As Reddit\'s profile and popularity has risen, its management has historically shown a touch-and-go approach to policing certain of its subreddits (member-founded-and-moderated communities, where users gather to discuss anything under the sun)\xe2\x80\x94especially, until recent years, the most toxic among them. In 2011, the site made one of its first major moves tobana subreddit: /r/jailbait, a community dedicated to exactly what it sounds like. Until that point, /r/jailbait andother controversial subredditshad been allowed to exist under the site\'s lassiez faire approach to free speech (even then, it was only removed largely after seeingwidespread media attention). But the ban was a tacit acknowledgement by Reddit management that overseeing a website of this magnitude brings innate ethical responsibilities.It wouldn\'t be until the 2015introductionof an explicit anti-harassment policy, and the subsequent ban ofseveral of the site\'s most toxic communities, that Reddit would take a more active role in policing its rampant harassment and hate speech.Having learned from theimbrogliothat followed\xe2\x80\x94and with the site\'s policy on what constitutes harassment nowexplicitly defined\xe2\x80\x94Redditors seeking to engage in hate speech began forming or infiltratingless flagrantly antagonisticniche subbreddits, tiptoeing right up to the line of Terms of Service (TOS)-breaking activity.This tactical shift dovetailed with the website\'s pivotal role in the 2016 US presidential election. The more internet-savvy elements of Trump\'s base (and potentially some Russian bots) used the controlled forum format togame the site\'s popularity algorithmsand amplify thebigoted subtextof Trump\'s platform. As Election Day drew nearer and fear-mongering efforts were redoubled, the more volatile enclaves of certain subreddits\xe2\x80\x94particularly /r/The_Donald, a massive subreddit dedicated to Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x94began engaging in real worlddoxxingandharassment. By now, Reddit had undeniably become a breeding ground for extremism.After the election, the company found itself mired in a game of subreddit ban whack-a-mole that treated symptoms but never touched the disease. Whenever a subreddit like/r/pizzagateor/r/altrightcrossed the TOS line and was shut down, the members of each group would simply disperse to cloned or tangential subreddits and spew their hatred anew. Despite pushback fromadminsand thenon-hateful majorityof the user base, the latent issue persists to this day.As there\'s nothing worse than heading into your favorite little hyper-specific subreddit only to discover it\'s been taken over by posters maligning Muslims or commenters degrading women, I\'ve put together a primer on which subreddits are even greater cesspools of white male fragility than the rest of the site, so that you can stay vigilant when venturing in or avoid them altogether./r/The_DonaldWhat it pretends it is:The premiere forum to discuss all things Donald Trump.What it actually is:The premiere "safe space" on the web that bans any and all users who dare offer anything but total fealty to "God Emperor Trump," as he\'s known in these parts, let alone dissenting opinions. It\'s a 24/7 Trump rally that also serves as a"melting pot of frustration and hate."Though its more overt displays ofracism,Islamophobia, and calls forextrajudicial murder of political opponentsare less common now, one needn\'t dig too far past its front page to find vestiges of election-era toxicity or concerted groupefforts to harass people opposed to Trump(andAriana Grande)."Muslims are insects."/r/MetaCanadaWhat it pretends it is:The_Donald, but Canadian.What it really is:Buncha hosers who\'re none-to-pleased that they live in a progressive country that doesn\'t religiously discriminate as much as its southern neighbor. Eschewing the politeness stereotypical of Canadians, this sub\'s users instead spend their time cheering the deaths of those who had the gall to befeminist(or simplynot Islamophobic). So full of Canadian pride is this lot that theywish for its downfalland muse aboutassassinating Justin Trudeauas remedies for the country\'s gradual diversification."The murder victim deserved it for being a race traitor."/r/EuropeanWhat is pretends it is:A place for people from the continent of Europe to discuss all things European.What is really is:A sanctuary where all thenext-levelbigotscast out of /r/Europe can, under the banner of free speech, circle-jerk about all the Muslim immigrants coming to rape and kill their beautiful European women."Only white murder victims are worth mourning."/r/UncensoredNewsWhat it pretends it is:The unpleasant truths the (((mainstream media))) doesn\'t want you to see.What it really is:Yet another place to bash not justMuslims, but all sorts of brown people. /r/UncensoredNews goes above and beyond merely "tolerating" hate speech: They actively court it. And in no uncertain terms, either: see this text post titled, "Here at uncensored news we love racism, bigotry, misogyny, hatred, xenophobia, transphobia, homo phobia etc."/r/ImgoingtohellforthisWhat it pretends it is:According to the sidebar, "tasteless \'politically incorrect\' dark, offensive, &amp; twisted humor of all types is welcome here." Y\'know, like dead baby and 9/11 jokes.What it really is:Painfully unoriginal memes that lean on hackneyed stereotypes aboutblack people,Muslims,women, and theLGBTQ community, usually with less comedic structure than a Laffy Taffy wrapper, and sometimeswith no joke pretenseat all."Murder feminists."/r/CringeAnarchyWhat it pretends it is:Not your daddy\'s "cringe" subreddit. Here, instead of embarrassing conversation screencaps, you\'ll find therealcringe, which is\xe2\x80\xa6 people who advocate for inclusionary, egalitarian, or otherwise progressive stances, apparently.What it really is:Credit where credit\'s due, /r/CringeAnarchy wears its shriveled, black heart on its sleeve\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, in its sidebar. It\'s pretty upfront that the sub is no place for "social justice faggots" or "white knights." The major bee in/r/CringeAnarchy\'s bonnet aretrans people, whosemere existenceis nothing short of a personal attack to the sub\'s denizens. It\'s a bummer that what was once a pretty good cringe sub has devolved into post likethis,this, andthis, all from the past month./r/DankMemesWhat it pretends it is:Top shelf memes too refined and edgy for normies.What it really is:More racism, largely. To be fair, the sub hasn\'t yetentirelybeen overtaken by bigot refugees from shuttered hate subs, but it\'s getting there. Whereas 4chan and its corresponding subreddits remain chaotic neutral, strictly "for the lulz" (does anyone even say that anymore?), and on high alert for legitimate racist ideologies attempting to infiltrate their party, DankMemes is happy to accept any and all shitpostsdisparaging a minority, as long as it has the ability to "trigger" non-dickheads."This has nothing to do with gaming but why pass up an opportunity to discredit BLM?"/r/KotakuInActionWhat it pretends it is:A Gaming-oriented subreddit where one can discuss (the lack of) ethics in gaming journalism, named after chief offender Kotaku.com.What it really is:Another place toshit on the leftand propagateracist right-wing rhetoricwith verbiagelifted straight from /r/The_Donaldand posts that often featurelittle-to-no discussion of video games. What doesdefending the Charlottesville Naziwho murdered a woman with his car have to do with review sites being too cozy with game developers? That sounds like the sort of question a cuck libtard would ask."This app designed specifically to make a point that nobody will actually use in earnest makes me hate women even more, somehow."/r/TumblrInActionWhat it pretends it is:Cringey examples of SJWs overreaching, particularly those originating from Tumblr.What it really is:A less egregious version of /r/KotakuInAction. While the sub does primarily upvote the more insufferable elements of the left, they\'ll also never pass up an opportunity to tear down astraw(wo)man feministor proclaim thatthere are only two genders."A woman was insulted. Nice!"/r/PussyPass &amp; /r/PussyPassDeniedWhat they pretend they are:Expos\xc3\xa9s on the disparity in how men and women are treated in the eyes of the law and media, and scenes of women who attempt to use their femininity for preferential treatment, who summarily get shut down.What they really are:After a hostile takeover left the subs rife with full-onNazisympathizingandpropagandaposts, the original users banded together to return the subs to their original format\xe2\x80\x94usinganger-stoking news storiesto justifymisogynyand gleefully cheerretaliatory violence against women./r/MensRightsWhat it pretends it is:A collection of activists sharing news about the infringement of "men\'s rights," seeking more parity from the justice system, like 50/50 child custody in divorce cases.What it really is:Shedding its noble original mission statement, MensRights has devolved into the sort ofanti-SJW/feminist/womencesspool that comprises the rest of this list. Postsequivocating away rape,defending rapists, anddenying systemic oppression of womenare more commonplace than anything else."That murderous drug kingpin\'s wet blanket wife was the true villain of the show."/r/MGTOWWhat it pretends it is:A subreddit for "men going their own way," whatever that means.What it really is:Extra-saltymisogyny. You\'ll find all the classic hits like"punch feminists,""wives are money leeches,"and"women who don\'t want to fuck you don\'t warrant common courtesies"in there, as well as some rare B-sides like"single moms suck"and"baseball knowledge should be a voting prerequisite.""Cant get laid? Just rape someone."/r/IncelsWhat it pretends it is:A haven for the the "involuntarily celibate" to commiserate over their perpetual virginity.What it really is:You\'d think that, with /r/incel gettingbannedfor going too far off the virginal reservation with its hatred of women, the nearly identical pluralized version of the sub would dial it back a bit. Unfortunately, despite there being rare earnestwords of advicein the sub, thetoxicitystillburblesto thesurface. The virgins here aren\'t the harmless sad sack Eeyore-types of/r/ForeverAlone. Instead, they take a more nihilistic approach to their curse, subscribing to the "Black Pill" theory that the universe will always be rigged against certain individuals, so why even bother trying to manipulate women into sex with "Red Pill" tactics?Follow Justin Caffieron Twitter.Tagged:InternetDonald TrumpNazisRedditmisogynyBigotryneckbeardssubredditSubscribe to the VICE newsletter.Subscribe'<|endoftext|>b'Why Reddit Is Cracking Down on Some of Its Most Active Users | Inc.comWhy Reddit Is Cracking Down on Some of Its Most Active UsersWireWhy Reddit Is Cracking Down on Some of Its Most Active UsersIt will take more than one rogue subreddit to tear down the Front Page of the Internet. But here\'s what its latest hubbub means for Reddit--and why its CEO is laying down the law.ByChristine Lagorio-ChafkinSenior writer, Inc.@LagorioPresident-elect Donald Trump.Getty ImagesBack in mid-2015, which sometimes seems like a long time ago, the nascentpresidential campaigns were chugging along, and on Reddit, Bernie Sanders was king. Partially to counter the powerful r/SandersForPresident, a volunteer moderator created Reddit.com/r/The_Donald.The Donald Trump-supporting message board onReddit--the company created in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanianto be a "Front Page of the Internet" withinYCombinator\'s first batch of startups--wasn\'t much at first. It was just some supporters of Donald J. Trump\'s candidacy posting links to news articles on a pretty typical topic page, or subreddit. Since then, of course, Trump has shocked the world by winning the presidency, and The_Donald has transformed into a virile community that\'s proven to be one of the most active and influential in Reddit\'s history. (More on that in a moment.)Today, Reddit is taking a new step to rein it in.Huffman, the company\'s chief executive,posted an announcementon Reddit saying the company would take a more aggressive stance against trollish behavior on The_Donald, as well as halt the capability of one of the community\'s favored virality tactics. Specifically, it will limit the power of moderators to select which posts become super-popular by "sticky"-ing them to the top of The_Donald. Posts that have been stickied by moderators will not be able to appear on one of the site\'s homepages. Reddit has also pledged to work harder to censure "hundreds of the most toxic users" on The_Donald.At issue: In recent months, the tone of The_Donald has shifted--and its community has been called out for going on the attack outside its subreddit. A moderator of r/Politics, the main board for political discussions of all stripes, hascalled The_Donald "toxic." It has become known for veiled racism, sexism, and Islamophobia, and has developed its own insider dialect that makes it tough for outsiders to comprehend.It also has become a force on Reddit and beyond, thanks to its dozens of moderators and far-flung network of supporters\' mastery of the site\'s algorithm--and because of their sheer intensity and engagement. Posts from The_Donald regularly rise to the top of r/All--which loyal redditors use as an alternative homepage. The_Donald, in thewords of Huffman, aims to "dominate the conversation." One way moderators of The_Donald communicate to the community to jump on upvoting a post is to sticky it--something most other moderators throughout Reddit use to denote simple announcements. Now, stickied posts are banned from r/All.The_Donald subreddit has gained about 10,000 subscribers in the past two weeks; there are now more than 300,000 subscribers. That number itself is not what makes The_Donald so impressive, but rather it\'s the degree to which those subscribers are focused and engaged. Huffman told me at a conference in Brooklyn two weeks ago that subscribers to The_Donald are six times more active than typical redditors, meaning they upvote or comment or post far more often than is typical. They are, in The_Donald speak, "high-energy."The_Donald made it a goal, and something of a game, to spread posts further than its narrow reach. On Reddit, posts with a massive amount of quick activity are picked up as popular and rise to the top of r/All. There, they reach a larger audience. (The_Donald has also developed a strong defensive streak when it comes to accusations of racism, sexism, or Islamophobia. Its rules explicitly state "no racism/anti-semitism." Recently, a The_Donald moderator posted, "Reddit admins have reached out to us and accused us of "fostering," and "encouraging," harassment. BULLSHIT." So.)That The_Donald\'s denizens got so good at spreading its posts was one reason behind Reddit\'s earlier decision to tweak its algorithm to make it harder for any subreddit to vault its posts to the top of r/All. Huffman wrote this summer that while the change was not targeted at The_Donald, he "cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment." The subreddit\'s behavior,he wrote, "undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it."The_Donald has been targeting Huffman ever since. It has called for his resignation, in a post two months ago that received more than 4,000 upvotes. It has called him "butthurt" and "top cuck" in post subject lines. Oh, and a "pedophile enablist" (sic).Huffman hasn\'t reacted calmly. He admitted last week to trolling back, replacing his username, "spez," with that of The_Donald mods for about an hour. "As much as we try to maintain a good relationship with you all, it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly. As the CEO, I shouldn\'t play such games, and it\'s all fixed now,"he wrote, noting that the posts he\'d edited had been restored to their previous CEO-bashing state.One could consider Huffman\'s moves terrible publicity, and bad for Reddit\'s attempt to mature as a site and as a business. But as one of the site\'s founders, it\'s not out of character for him to be the ur-troll--and perhaps he endeared himself to others frustrated with The_Donald.This week, one The_Donald moderatorposted: "In light of Spez\'s antics, it has become abundantly clear that we are not welcome here. GOOD" and "We will stay here and shitpost our hearts out" until "they MAKE us go somewhere." (For the uninitiated: "shitposting" is, at base, a shitty post or comment. For a more thorough explanation, dive inhereorhereorhere.)Policing the The_Donald community as it has evolved into a shitposting haven has been a particular challenge, in part because many of its discussions are shrouded in insider vernacular that has evolved to the point where the meaning is hard to discern. Still, according to a Reddit staffer, more individual posters and comments are removed from The_Donald than any other part of Reddit.In Huffman\'s Wednesday post,he noted that: "Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit."The issue with The_Donald and other troublesome communities on the site is that the line between what\'s a problem and what\'s not is subjective. It\'s slippery and subtle. One person\'s spam is another person\'s lunch. One person\'s harassment is another person\'s lighthearted jab. Historically, Reddit has tried to come down (mostly) on the side of favoring free speech, or allowing users to drive the discussions. This is why, say, pedophilia is banned on the site, but discussions about the concept of treatment for or recovery from pedophilia are not.The future of Reddit--because of\xc2\xa0its ambitions for massive user and ad revenue growth--just might hang on such fine distinctions.Gizmodoin a recent articleproposes that another possible reason Reddit isn\'t banning The_Donald is financial. Ads appear alongside The_Donald\'s content, as they do elsewhere on the site--but traffic on that subreddit is nothing compared with, say, r/trees, the popular subreddit surrounding cannabis culture.Huffman says he won\'t ban The_Donald. In fact, he writes, rather earnestly: "More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban ther/the_donaldoutright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so."Whether the company is up for targeting more than a couple hundred users remains unclear. Gizmodo estimates that there could be more than 40,000 of those sorts of troublemaking accounts. But, it notes, ban too many people, and the site could revolt: "After the ban of r/FatPeopleHate Reddit became near-unusable. The displaced users, with nothing left to lose, stirred up as much trouble as they could, and likely the Reddit admins fear a repeat."Reddit has weatheredmore significant user revoltsthan this. But watch for Reddit to start monitoring, and banning, members of other fringe groups--especially those with their own coded speech, unique community-defying behaviors, and power in numbers. Advertisers, especially huge ones like Coke, do worry about the environment they\'re in.Then again, as of this morning, a gif of afluffy orange-and-white cat appearing very confused about falling snowflakeshad thousands more votes than anything at the top of The_Donald. Yes, The_Donald is unusually influential--especially for an ultra-insider club that speaks its own impenetrable language. But it is not Reddit.Published on: Nov 30, 2016More from Inc.Sponsored Business Content-->-->CHANNELSSTARTUPGROWLEADINNOVATETECHNOLOGYMONEYINC. 5000VIDEOMORE INC.EVENTSNEWSLETTERSMAGAZINEBRANDVIEWPODCASTSSUBSCRIBESUBSCRIBEMAGAZINEDIGITAL EDITIONFOLLOW INC.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 2018 Manuseto VenturesHelp CenterAdvertisePrivacySitemap'<|endoftext|>b"Statistical Proof of Shitposting in Crypto SubredditsKendrick TanAboutPostsResumeTalksAboutPostsResumeTalksMar 1, 2018Statistical Proof of Shitposting in Crypto SubredditsPreludeA couple of days ago, an idea came to mind:Crypto-currencies that have a high marketcap must have a consensus on quality discussions within their community that distinguishes themselves from the rest of the pack.Sounds like a reasonable hypothesis, no? Now if I could somehow find cryptocurrencies with a similar pattern of quality discussions on Reddit which haven't 'mooned' yet, I could potentially make bank ( \xcd\xa1\xc2\xb0 \xcd\x9c\xca\x96 \xcd\xa1\xc2\xb0).Oh boy, was I sowrong.Data Aggregration and ProcessingAfter checking out a couple of platforms I decided to settle on aggregating data from Reddit because:Most, if not all crypto-projects have a subredditRelatively active communityLots of documentation on how to aggregate data from RedditI started off by getting the top 350 coins and their official subreddit. The marketcap of the lowest and highest from the list ranged from 20 mil all the way up to 100 bil, so I thought I had a pretty diverse range. I obtained the data viacoinmarketcap's api.Next up was associating each project with their relavent subreddit. There wasn't an easy and reliable way to automate it, and so much of it wasdone by hand(\xe0\xb8\x87'\xcc\x80-'\xcc\x81)\xe0\xb8\x87.With the list of subreddits, I can now easily grab the top titles and their respective updoots via the JSON endpoint. E.g.:reddit.com/r/ethereum/top/.jsonOnce that was complete I chucked the aggregated data intoTfidfVectorizerwhich returns me anNdimensional matrix that describes the document. The output is then passed the output throughPCAwhich compresses theNdimensional matix into 2D so we can visualize it.Analyzing the DataRecall the hypothesis:quality content = quality community = quality cryptoshit    content = shit    community = shit    cryptoIn an ideal world, we should be able to see crypto communities with a similar marketcap cluster together, like the graph below. (Pay no attention to the metrics / axis as they're just the top 2 principal components of the data. Just focus on where the data-point is positioned relative to their marketcap.)But instead we got:Notice how most the pointsregardlessof marketcap congregate in one area. That basically means that crypto-subreddits regardless of marketcap, posts similar content. Now go to any crypto subreddit, filter by top of &lt;period&gt;, you should see that it's a shit post. So according to the original hypothesis, all posts are now shitposts. BAM! There you go!You now have statistical proof that all top posts on crypto-subreddits comprises of shitposts.Some people with a sharp eye might argue, hey, what about that mid-right section? You know that section comprises mostly of 500Mil++ marketcap. What does that contain?I will admit, that got me excited for a second, until I analyzed what those points represented:Turns out, that section represented reddit titles which had the wordbitcoinin it. Naturally bitcoin and bitcoin-cash frequently had that word in their titles, which represented the majority of the points in that section. When it was used in other high marketcap crypto subreddit it was used to amplify its (the respective crypto) superiority over bitcoin. Anyhow, no worries, it's still a shitpost amirite?Analyzing top posts by month yields the same result:Conclusion and Tl;DRAll crypto subreddits rewards shitposting behavior.MiscIf you want to play around with your own graphs you can grab thecryptoshitposting repository here.You should alsofollow my favorite cat on instagram: mr.miso.oz.571 Words2018-03-01NewerHow to Install GHC v8+ on UbuntuOlderCapsule Networks Explained\xc2\xa9 2019\xc2\xb7 Kendrick TanMade withHugo\xc2\xb7 ThemeHermit\xc2\xb7"<|endoftext|>b"bellingcat - Shitposting, Inspirational Terrorism, and the Christchurch Mosque Massacre - bellingcatthe home of online investigationsSearch for:HomeAfricaAmericasMENARest of WorldUK &amp; EuropeArticlesCase StudiesEventsGuidesPodcastsENEnglish\xd1\x80\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9Search for:ContributorsContactAboutHomeRest of WorldChristchurchShitposting, Inspirational Terrorism, and the Christchurch Mosque MassacreMarch 15, 2019ByRobert EvansTranslations:\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9On Friday, March 15th, one or more gunmen opened fire in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. As I write this, three men and one woman have been taken into custody by local law enforcement. It is unclear to what extent they were all involved. The only thing we know is that one of the shooters went by the name Brenton Tarrant on Twitter. He posted pictures of the murder weapons there two days before the rampage. Said weapons are clearly visible in the video of the spree he livestreamed to Facebook.Shortly after the spree ended, New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed that several improvised explosive devices had been disarmed by authorities. If those devices were meant as some kind of booby trap, they were not the only trap \xe2\x80\x9cBrenton\xe2\x80\x9d left behind. Immediately before carrying out his spree, he posted links to a manifesto on Twitter:In \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Replacement\xe2\x80\x9d repeats a variety of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite genocide\xe2\x80\x9d talking points, and claims his murder of several dozen Muslims is because they are \xe2\x80\x9cinvaders\xe2\x80\x9d outbreeding the white race. All the evidence we have suggests these are, more or less, the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs.But this manifesto is a trap itself, laid for journalists searching for the meaning behind this horrific crime. There is truth in there, and valuable clues to the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s radicalization, but it is buried beneath a great deal of, for lack of a better word, \xe2\x80\x9cshitposting\xe2\x80\x9d.What is Shitposting?Shitposting is the act of throwing out huge amounts of content, most of it ironic, low-quality trolling, for the purpose of provoking an emotional reaction in less Internet-savvy viewers. The ultimate goal is to derail productive discussion and distract readers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Replacement\xe2\x80\x9d is a clear and brutally obvious example of this technique.In his manifesto, Brenton credits far-right personality Candace Owens with beginning his radicalization. He states that, \xe2\x80\x9cEach time she spoke I was stunned by her insights and her own views helped push me further and further into the belief of violence over meekness. Though I will have to disavow some of her beliefs, the extreme actions she calls for are too much, even for my tastes.\xe2\x80\x9dThis detail was picked up instantly by many people online. Owens herself issued a response that seemed almost calculated to generate rage from those on the left:But in the context of the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s online presence, and the rest of his manifesto, this was almost certainly misdirection. Here is what the author wrote immediately below the section crediting Owens for his radicalization. In it, he jokes that \xe2\x80\x9cSpyro the Dragon 3\xe2\x80\x9d, a video game, taught him \xe2\x80\x9cethno-nationalism\xe2\x80\x9d.It is possible, even likely that the author was a fan of Owens\xe2\x80\x99s videos: she certainly espousesanti-immigrant rhetoric. But in context seems likely that his references to Owens were calculated to spark division, and perhaps even violence, between the left and the right. At multiple points in the manifesto the author expresses the hope that his massacre will spark further attempts at gun control in the United States, which he believes will lead to gun confiscation and a civil war. He believes this civil war would be the best opportunity destroy the American \xe2\x80\x9cmelting pot\xe2\x80\x9d. This idea is repeated often enough that it seems to be something the author legitimately believes in.Given the tone surrounding the Candace Owens passage, it seems clear that it was \xe2\x80\x9cbait\xe2\x80\x9d, thrown out to attract attention on social media and sow further political division. The entire manifesto is dotted, liberally, with references to memes and Internet in-jokes that only the extremely online would get. For example, take this passage from his Q&amp;A:He goes on to repeat, at length,the Navy SEAL Copypasta, a humorous meme that originated on 4chan circa 2010. The whole manifesto is dotted with little bits like that. They are meant to distract attention from his more honest points, and to draw the attention of his real intended audience.This Was An Act of Inspirational TerrorismBefore beginning his bloody spree, the Christchurch shooter- presumably the same person who wrote the manifesto- announced his intentions to 8chan\xe2\x80\x99s /pol/ board. He opened by saying that it is \xe2\x80\x9ctime to stop shitposting and time to make a real life effort\xe2\x80\x9d.Now there are some things the author truly believes, and those things are not hidden- although they are less obvious than his statements about Candace Owens. For one thing, the shooter repeatedly references Oswald Mosley. Mosley was the founder of the British Union of Fascists, a political party in the 1930s that sought to return England to a state of \xe2\x80\x9cautarchy\xe2\x80\x9d, or complete financial and cultural independence from the rest of the world. The author\xe2\x80\x99s violent anti-immigrant rhetoric jibes completely with this. Mosley is not an entirely obscure figure, but he is also not a particularly prominent thinker in the 21stcentury right wing.The words painted on the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s rifle offer further clues as to his ideology:The 14s, which are repainted in several locations on his weapons, are a reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cfourteen words\xe2\x80\x9d written by jailed neo-Nazi bank robber David Lane:\xe2\x80\x9cWe must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\xe2\x80\x9d Lane was a member of a neo-Nazi terrorist group named The Order, which was inspired by a group of the same name in a White Nationalist fiction book titledThe Turner Diaries. InThe Turner Diaries, The Order succeeds in sparking a vicious sectarian civil war in the United States through a series of deadly terrorist attacks. This gels with the author\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references to sparking internecine conflict in the United States.The author does not claim membership to any specific far-right group, and also denies being a Neo-Nazi. Instead, he expresses a sort of allegiance- and ideological sympathy, to several other mass shooters, including Dylann Roof and Anders Breivik. He claims to have been in contact with Breivik, and that the Norwegian mass-shooter\xe2\x80\x99s manifesto was his \xe2\x80\x9ctrue inspiration\xe2\x80\x9d.Breivik\xe2\x80\x99s manifesto has provided inspiration to a number of far-right killers and would-be killers, most recentlyCoast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Hasson. The author repeatedly states his hope that his spree, and his manifesto, inspires other people to kill.And that brings us back to 8chan. In addition to sewing discord and creating confusion, the Christchurch shooter\xe2\x80\x99s repeated references to memes and in-jokes were him playing to this very specific crowd. The streamed video of his massacre begins with him telling viewers to \xe2\x80\x9cSubscribe to PewDiePie\xe2\x80\x9d. This is a reference to yet anotherfringe Internet meme. Yet another dumb, trollish move calculated to please the other shitposters on 8chan.And how did they respond to this massacre?Over and over again, through page after page of posts, anons celebrated this mass murder by one of their own.Most of the (very few) negative remarks found in the thread are from people, like one of the above posters, who fear this spree will mark \xe2\x80\x9cthe end of 8pol\xe2\x80\x9d. The shooter\xe2\x80\x99s frequent use of in-jokes and memes played extremely well with this crowd.They even remark on his choice of music during his drive to commit the massacre:\xe2\x80\x9cRemove Kebab\xe2\x80\x9d. The song is from a propaganda music video made by Serb Army soldiers as a tribute to war criminalRadovan Karad\xc5\xbei\xc4\x87. (Remove Kebab was also written on one of the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s firearms.)The shooter seems to have achieved his goal of providing the anons of 8chan with lulz, and with inspiration. One user hailed him as \xe2\x80\x9cthe next Breivik\xe2\x80\x9d. And before much more than an hour had passed, there were already calls for other anons to follow in his bloody footsteps.Sharethis article:Robert Evans has worked as a conflict journalist in Iraq and Ukraine and reported extensively on far-right extremist groups in the United States.

But how does that happen exactly? In the case of dark fantasy mangaBerserk\xe2\x80\x99s 26-year-old fandom, it happened when the stale franchise\xe2\x80\x99s subreddit fell into the hands of an over-pious fan. When that self-mockery took form, it congealed into/r/Berserk\xe2\x80\x99s shitposting offspring,/r/Berserklejerk.A primer: /r/Berserk is dedicated toBerserk, the chronicles of the one-eyed mercenary Guts as he cuts through his haunted past with the enormous bastard sword Dragonslayer. Demons, graphic violence, transgressive sexual behavior and overa thousanddead bodies have established the manga as one of the darkest of all time. Its medieval, Christian-tinged landscape is ripe for exploring questions of morality and sacrifice. With 38 manga volumes, a \xe2\x80\x9890s anime series, three movies, a video game and a new 2016 anime, fans have been asking those questions since 1989.AdvertisementOn /r/Berserk, Redditors debate weighty topics such as the depiction of religion or duality of evil in the series. And, with increasing intensity, they do it and have done it, at length, for over two decades on various forums. (Lately, they also post about developments inBerserk, which is recently flush with new content). Even the most devoutBerserkfans have come to call the community a \xe2\x80\x9ccircle jerk,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to theReddit tropethat over-earnest subreddits often devolve into caricatures of themselves. Thus: /r/Berserklejerk, the fandom\xe2\x80\x99s freak cousin, a non-stop trickle of unintelligible posts and tasteless memes that run contrary to the spirit ofBerserk:\xe2\x80\x9cdis has to be bumserk refren,\xe2\x80\x9d reads one post.\xe2\x80\x9ci kild fitty men,\xe2\x80\x9d reads another./r/Berserklejerk is the scum that aggregated above a stagnant content pond, a loving but irreverent tribute to a fiercely traditionalist fandom. Compared toBerserk\xe2\x80\x99s 20,000-strong subreddit, /r/Berserklejerk\xe2\x80\x99s 1,600 regular posters are but a small, derpy army. But the bubbling-over ofBerserk\xe2\x80\x99s grave, esoteric culture into /r/Berserklejerk is an interesting lesson in how one fan community has made something new out of decades of frustrated fandom.Berserkfans are passionate, in part because they have to be. True devotees have stuck withBerserkthrough the manga\xe2\x80\x99s significant and unpredictable delays, ranging from several months to over a year. During one of those manga breaks in 2015, WalterBennet was tapped to mod /r/Berserk. He\xe2\x80\x99s is known among the community for his conservative approach to the series\xe2\x80\x93he can quote the manga by memory, and often does when fan speculation deviates at all from the original material, which was being sparsely released during his mod-ship.

He also believes /r/Berserklejerk was created in response to his stern presence on Reddit, as a refuge for the irreverent shitposting he reviled.AdvertisementLast July, a /r/Berserk regular asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you guys think we\xe2\x80\x99ll ever be able to be brooding and contemplative again?\xe2\x80\x9d It was nearing the last few weeks of a 43-week mangabreak. In the post\xe2\x80\x99s title, he describes the subreddit as a \xe2\x80\x9cBerserklejerk.\xe2\x80\x9d In response, a Redditor named HomoVehkuel registered /r/Berserklejerk, a space forBerserk\xe2\x80\x99s intensely solemn, devoted fans to engage in some gross self-mockery./r/Berserklejerk is whereBerserkfans come to blow off steam when their favorite franchise\xe2\x80\x99s release schedule is cruel, or when the community is being too navel-gazey. The subreddit is so unhinged that regulars have their own dialect of English (\xe2\x80\x9chee reechd hez foinal furm!,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfishal scen of berserku splained\xe2\x80\x9d). \xe2\x80\x9cGuts\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cGattts\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGattsu\xe2\x80\x9d; The Dragonslayer sword is simply \xe2\x80\x9cCLANG,\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cC;LANG,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the metallic sound it makes in the new anime. The God Hand, five reality-warping apostles of the Idea of Evil, a deity of sorts, are in /r/Berserklejerk the \xe2\x80\x9cgodfoot,\xe2\x80\x9d also the name of the subreddit\xe2\x80\x99s mods. In /r/Berserklejerk, \xe2\x80\x9cDo your worst\xe2\x80\x9d is the mantra.Advertisement/r/Berserklejerk mirrors the seriousness with which WalterBennet-type fans approachBerserk, collecting the sort of posts that he would instantly delete and the people he would perma-ban (or, in /r/Berserklejerk-speak, \xe2\x80\x9cbenn\xe2\x80\x9d). Fittingly, on /r/Berserklejerk, a ridiculous WalterBennet shadow persona materialized: WalterPeanut.\xe2\x80\x9cOh yeah, I wanted to make fun of him,\xe2\x80\x9d WalterPeanut explained over Gchat. WalterPeanut was an original champion of /r/Berserklejerk, which, he said, came about to fill the emotional gaps left by the manga\xe2\x80\x99s frequent hiatuses and the severity of WalterBennet\xe2\x80\x99s reign overBerserkfandom. WalterPeanut loves the series, but he reviled the community\xe2\x80\x99s so-called \xe2\x80\x9cconstant\xe2\x80\x9d circle-jerking, a result of the its seriousness and the manga\xe2\x80\x99s slow releases. On a Reddit post, WalterPeanut described the inception of /r/Berserklejerk as \xe2\x80\x9cthe best day of [his] life.\xe2\x80\x9dAdvertisementBerserk\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 animeGabrielfhelm, one of /r/Berserklejerk\xe2\x80\x99s God Feet, describes the subreddit as a place whereBerserkfans can chill out after engaging in /r/Berserk\xe2\x80\x99s detailed and speculatory discussions. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is here that we make light of an otherwise dark, tragic manga, with the intent of relaxing one\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. By the subreddit\xe2\x80\x99s rules, he explained to me, \xe2\x80\x9cevery post must be a shitpost,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that it has to be spammy, derail the conversation or mean nothing at all.AdvertisementFor instance, inBerserkchapter 124, a demonically-possessed horse attempts to rape noblewoman Farnese de Vandimion. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the manga\xe2\x80\x99s most painful and horrifying moments, one that WalterBennet describes as \xe2\x80\x9ca consequence ofBerserk\xe2\x80\x99s brutal world.\xe2\x80\x9d In /r/Berserklejerk, that horse is referred to as \xe2\x80\x9crapehorse,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9craephors,\xe2\x80\x9d daily, reflecting the subreddit\xe2\x80\x99s trollish tastelessness./r/Berserklejerk\xe2\x80\x99s rules enforcing shitposts stand in direct contrast to /r/Berserk\xe2\x80\x99s moderation policies, which ban \xe2\x80\x9ctrolling, shit posts, spam, or repeated topics.\xe2\x80\x9d In /r/Berserklejerk, nobody breaks that rule. On July 30th, /r/Berserklejerk concluded the third round of its \xe2\x80\x9cBest Shitpost\xe2\x80\x9d tournament. The results:Advertisement/r/BerserklejerkThere\xe2\x80\x99s significant crossover in the subreddits, a byproduct of the strength of theBerserkcommunity.Berserkfans will, one day, muse on the nature of vengeance, and the next, post supremely awful \xe2\x80\x9cGattz\xe2\x80\x9d memes on /r/Berserklejerk. Many fans have /r/Berserklejerk alter egos, the darker sides of their dark manga fandom.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people have alternate /r/Berserklejerk accounts, so they can troll each other,\xe2\x80\x9d former /r/Berserklejerk mod and current /r/Berserk mod VolatileCurry explained. For the most part, the same people populate both subreddits. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget that they\xe2\x80\x99re all a part of the same fandom and that, aside from the degrees of reverence with which they approachBerserk, the two communities are in fact one.Because of this, /r/Berserklejerk has planned a few raids on /r/Berserk that never transpired. One month ago, a poster announced that it was \xe2\x80\x9ctiem to claim /r/berserk as our slaves and servants.\xe2\x80\x9d Although smaller instances of cross-forum trolling occur every now and then, a larger raid had never gone down. Berserklejerkers were ramping up to smear their shitposts all over the pristineBerserksubreddit, until, strangely, Gabrielfhelm put his God Foot down:\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not wish to put /u/VolatileCurry (friend and former God Foot) in an undesirable position seeing as he is a moderator at /r/Berserk,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in decipherable English.AdvertisementBerserk 2016 animeLove forBerserkcan transcend fans\xe2\x80\x99 beliefs on shitposting. Even the superserious WalterBennet isn\xe2\x80\x99t immune: Once he connected with his shadow persona WalterPeanut, he realized that they actually got along. WalterPeanut\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for the series, somehow, shone through the shitposting\xe2\x80\x94to be a real troll, you need to know your subject matter, a trait that WalterBennet admires.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a parody of me,\xe2\x80\x9d WalterBennet said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut is also a decent user. He\xe2\x80\x99s a regular dude.\xe2\x80\x9d Although he considers /r/Berserklejerk\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csense of humor to be depreciating the series,\xe2\x80\x9d he understands that fans find value in /r/Berserklejerk. \xe2\x80\x9cThe conflict between theBerserkand Berserklejerk subreddits is a conflict of opinion about tone,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.As of recently, theBerserkfranchise has started picking up a lot more steam. Kentaro Miura is releasing manga chapters. A new anime adaption launched a few months ago. The hack-and-slash video gameBerserk Musuowill be released this fall for PlayStation 4 and PC. Recently, /r/Berserk saw an influx of \xe2\x80\x9ccasuals,\xe2\x80\x9d in VolatileCurry\xe2\x80\x99s words, referring to new fans brought on by the 2016 anime, which the community has, generally, found overwhelmingly disappointing. A few days ago, /r/Berserk exceeded 20,000 members.AdvertisementWithout the staleness that has plaguedBerserkfandom for years, and with new blood in the fandom, /r/Berserklejerk may wither and dry up, an infected inside joke. Or, with more content to feed the circlejerking machine, maybe it will continue to thrive.Share This StoryAbout the authorCecilia D'AnastasioCecilia D'AnastasioSenior reporter at Kotaku.EmailTwitterPostsShareTweet"<|endoftext|>b'Sakuga Reddit Discussion? | sakugabooru              body div#post-view > div#right-col > div > div#note-container > div.note-body {        overflow: visible;      }          We\'ve started a blog!

I\'m a big fan of this site and visit it daily for updates on who animated my favorite scenes, but I do feel like it\'s rare that the comments foster real discussion/analysis about the sakuga.Not sure if there\'s a lot of crossover between reddit and this site, but is there anyone here who\'d be interested in participating in a weekly discussion about the sakuga in the week\'s simulcast shows? I\'m reasonably knowledgeable about sakuga but nowhere near the level of some of the uploaders on this site.QuoteArasanover 4 years agoWhy not discuss it on /a/ instead? That way we can have sakuga, dank memes, and shitposting all in one thread.QuoteCobblesabout 4 years ago/a/ is a crapshoot. Sometimes you can have good discussion, most of the time you can\'t. Or at least that\'s how it was a couple years agoQuoteKraker2kabout 4 years agoI\'m game for it. I\'ve always been interested in having a place to discuss sakuga with people in some way or form. Over the years I\'ve tried on forums, which didn\'t work since not many people register to unknown forums. We tried with the 4chan BBS for a few years but that eventually turned to crap due to the spammers and trolls. Technically this forum is always here but as FA says, not many people come here for discussion.Right now Twitter and IRC is where low level of sakuga discussion takes place. Since Reddit is quite popular at the moment, it offers the same benefits as /a/ but you don\'t lose your threads and you don\'t have to suffer the contempt of Anonymous users. I\'ve thought about doing this myself for a while but I never got round to it. I know /r/Sakuga exists but it is barely used from what I can recall.QuoteFierceAlchemistabout 4 years agoWell I\'ve done two of these posts now, trying to make it a weekly Sunday thing.https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3c8ief/summer_week_1_sakuga_discussion_spoilers/Quotejepover 3 years agoWell...

These are large and vibrant groups, with followers in the tens of thousands.But for some folks who are just coming out as trans, memes and GIFs \xe2\x80\x94 not traditional, location-based support groups or advice-based subreddits \xe2\x80\x94 are where they first find community.Taker/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns, Reddit\'s oldest active subreddit for trans-centered shitposts, memes, and GIFs. \xc2\xa0Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns currently has over 84,300 "shitposters," many of whom post meaningful content about transphobia or transitioning, then disguise it inshitpost robesor meme make-up.Over atr/GaySoundsShitposts, another trans-focused meme subreddit, you\'ll find even more introspective, cutting memes, combined with people\'s earnest observations about trans life. Meanwhile, r/TransQualityGifsshares narrative-driven GIFs about the trans community.ContraPoints nailing the absurdity of being transfromTransQualityGifsEach of these subreddits has a slightly different tone and their own rules for moderation. What they all share in common is a sense of community-building: The mods know that, given the growth in trans visibility, their subreddits now serve more than just memes.Corinne, one of the moderators for the Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns subreddit, described it this way in a phone interview with Mashable:"When I started, it was a lot more edgy memes. Now it\'s more like a place where people can leave events, support others, and comfort others while seeking humor. We didn\'t realize the user base had changed so much. It was just a couple thousand people just making crass jokes. But really, by Christmas last year, it had became something more than that."Transtion timelinesfromtraaaaaaannnnnnnnnnsAs the trans community becomes more public, so do the meme groupsDespite the Trump administration\'s push to make life significantly harder for trans people, whether bybanning them from the militaryor eliminating theirprotections in schools, the trans community has only grown more visible in recent years. Caitlyn Jenner has moved partially out of the picture, allowingother trans leadersto move into the spotlight, and more teens identify as trans or gender non-conformingthan ever before.With the spike in public awareness came a growth in trans meme-centered subreddits. Just look at how much Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns, which started in 2012, has expanded recently. In just a little over a year, the subreddit has experienced a nearly 200 percent increase in subscribers.R/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns now has over 84,300 subscribersImage:  courtesty of reddit"I think a lot of it has to do with increasing acceptability," Corinne says. "Of course during this presidential administration we\'ve regressed a lot in terms of human rights. But in terms ofsocial consciousness,people are more aware of what being trans is. People want to know what options there are for people who experience gender dysphoria or who are not their assigned gender at birth. It\'s really hard to be able to explore those things alone ... We\'ve noticed we\'ve gotten more and more younger users. They are feeling more open in their lives to come out \xe2\x80\x94 at least come out online. So a lot of trans people turn to [us]."GaySoundsShitposts is a much younger subreddit, having formed a little over a year ago after a controversy developed on Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns. At the time, Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns had decided to eliminate any posts that weren\'t strictly memes and were more supportive/advice-seeking. (The subreddit has since relaxed their policy.) Some users migrated to GaySoundsShitposts, which was meme-focused but open to all forms of trans-centered content. Since then, it has grown to over 14,500 subscribers or "hatched eggs."Started T the other dayfromGaySoundsShitposts"When I volunteered to be a moderator, r/GaySoundsShitposts had about 500 subscribers," Evangeline Rose Ingram, one of the founding moderators of the subreddit and also a moderator for r/TransQualityGIFs, told Mashable in an email. "In the course of the month of December, that shot up toover five thousand ...R/GSSP is now at over 14,000 subscribers from its humble beginnings a year ago, and we see about 30,000 unique viewers per month."Neither Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns nor GaySoundsShitposts were able to support all the original content. Shortly after GaySoundsShitposts was founded, Reddit users six_inches_light and FoodOnion (who asked to be called only by their usernames) founded r/TransQualityGifs, dedicated to longer, more narrative-based content, all in the form of GIFs.If TransQualityGifs sounds familiar, it\'s probably because you\'ve heard ofr/HighQualityGifs, its close relative. Part of the reason Six_Inches_light and FoodOnion founded TransQualityGifs, the founders told Mashable, was because HighQualityGifs wasn\'t particularly trans-friendly.Every time I have to grow my facial hair out for electrolysis I like to embrace the girl beard. WHY NOT, RIGHT?!fromTransQualityGifs"What we wanted to encourage from the start was more trans GIFers to come out of their shell," FoodOnion told Mashable in a phone interview. "I like to do GIFs because it makes people feel represented in a more meaningful way ... With GIFs you can actually tell stories [as compared to a picture]."The subreddit currently enjoys over 3,100 trans\'scribers and counting \xe2\x80\x94 no small feat, given that the subreddit is fairly new and that GIFs are far more labor-intensive than memes.Self-exploration begins with memesModerator of GaySoundsShitposts Val K. isn\'t surprised to find so many trans folks who have either just come out or are thinking of coming out on the sub."After a person initially comes out, they often don\'t know anyone else who is trans," Val told Mashable in a phone interview. "If they\'re early to transition or they\'re quite late in life they probably wont\' know anyone. Trans Reddit provides a place for people to go, \'Oh, it\'s not just me. There are lots of other people like this.\'"me_irlfromGaySoundsShitpostsVal believes that meme-focused subreddits might be particularly appealing to those who are newly out and not ready for more explicit conversations about gender identity:"[Meme subreddits] can be good for people who aren\'t typically ready to talk to other people but need to get this out in some way ... People can talk about really heavy stuff and then use a custom emoji. That\'s kind of a way for someone to have emotional distance from the things they\'re going through."Evangeline Rose Ingram, Val\'s fellow moderator, agrees:"More than anywhere else on Reddit, r/GSSP is a home to me. We\'re all a bunch of dorks and we don\'t always get along perfectly, but it matters a lot to know that there are other trans people like me out there just living their lives one day at a time. For some of us, /r/GSSP is theonlyplace we feel at home."Allies doing goodfromGaySoundsShitpostsThe content on all three subreddits reflects this safe, protected, community-driven environment. There are hundreds of posts that explore gender dysphoria, coming out to your family and anxiety about transitioning. There are posts about passing and self-harm. Sometimes the material is deeply serious and hidden inSimpsonsGIFs or anime memes. Other times, the memes are just "in jokes" \xe2\x80\x94 material that, unless you\'re trans, you\'ll never fully understand. Which is just how it should be.It\'s a satirical and humane digital subcultural. Who cares if not all people get it?Here, for example, is a selection from a multi-part GIF series shared on TransQualityGIFs about being trans in church:When you accidentally out yourself to your parentsfromTransQualityGifsPart 2: Loose EndsfromTransQualityGifsSo many of the posts are profoundly, darkly comical."Trans people are often some of the most marginalized people in society," Corinne says. \xc2\xa0"So they develop thick skin, which translates into humor. Because a lot of trans people\'s experiences are pretty dark and pretty sad, there has got to be some way to keep the hope up [and this is one]."These subreddits can only do so muchFor all their inclusivity, the subreddits have limits. As a moderator for GaySoundsShitposts, Ingram works hard to ensure that the sub\'s subscribers have room for self-exploration (be it in meme form or the occasional advice-based post) while acknowledging the sub\'s limitations.Ingram explained that at the beginning, "[W]e were fielding about one major depressive crisis for day. We ultimately had to say, \'We\'re not trained for this, please call a crisis line,\' simply because everyone was burning out from intense stress \xe2\x80\x94 but we\'ve been shaped by that. We know that, by banning someone, we could be cutting their only lifeline."These subreddits provide community. But every community has their boundaries.TransQualityGIFs, GaySoundsShitposts, and traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns provide a critical home base for trans Redditors who love memes and GIFs. And as happy as Val K. is to provide that space for users, Val wants folks to travel beyond large, meme-based subreddits.One sub can\'t do it all."Our hope [for our subreddit] is that it doesn\'t grow too much," Val says. "People need to move on from it emotionally and ... [build] better support networks ... that are more close-knit. A community of 50 or so active people is typically what we want to get people into. That\'s a much better [environment] for people to be open and comfortable about stuff without needing an emotional barrier."SEE ALSO:Ally Moms provide a critical lifeline for trans youth and their parentsA smaller community \xe2\x80\x94 whether\'s it\'s on Reddit or elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 has the advantage of intimacy and personalization. GaySoundsShitposts can affirm your gender identity, but it likely can\'t tell you where to find the most trans-friendly doctor in your neighborhood. You can identify powerfully and emotionally with a GIF in TransQualityGIFs, but the GIF can\'t come out to your parents. Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns can validate your feelings about passing, but it can\'t always assist you in locating hormone replacement therapy.These subreddits are critical. They\'re meaningful, affirming, communities that go beyond their stated function. It\'s just important to have reasonable expectations.The memes are the start.WATCH: Twitter turned this massive fried rice prank into a pretty great meme \xe2\x80\x94 All the MemesTopics:Culture,identities,Memes,reddit,LGBTQAbout UsJobsAdvertiseSubscribeMashable Shop ContactPrivacyTermsFacebook mashableTwitter mashableFeeds mashablePinterest mashableYouTube mashableStumbleUpon mashableLinkedIn mashableMashableis a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Not the good kind you see dancing in bikinis on Independence Day, the bad kind that strips freedom from citizens and grants it to donors,\xe2\x80\x9d Luckeywrote on a Reddit threadintroducing his initiative, using the pseudonym NimbleRichMan.Luckey\xe2\x80\x99s support for Trump may be unusual in a tech industry that has a tendency to support Democrats, but it is his embrace of the dark side of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s internet army that is so alarming. We may be used to the incredibly wealthy supporting pro-business politicians by writing checks to the Republican party, but the full-on embrace of \xe2\x80\x9cshitposting\xe2\x80\x9d and the bigoted online harassment that so often comes with it is something else entirely.Shitpostingis not intended to add to an online discussion but to shut it down with, well, shit. It is the opposite of the ideals of good faith, open discussion made possible by the internet.Oculus Rift founder: 'Facebook as we know it is not the future of virtual reality'Read moreSince the Daily Beast report, Luckey has receivedscrutiny by reportersseeking evidence of an affinity between the man who invented Oculus Rift and the candidate whose campaign has centered on attacks on immigrants and Muslims. Among the revelations is the fact that Luckey\xe2\x80\x99s long-time girlfriend, Nicole Edelmann, is anapparent supporter of GamerGate, the anti-feminist online harassment movement that erupted in 2014.Luckey, it seems, represents both sides of the increasingly schizophrenic tech industry: innovating tools for increased connection and knowledge with one hand, and empowering reactionary abuse and harassment with the other.Luckey was just 18 when he built the first prototype for a virtual reality headset that would go on to raise almost $2.5m on Kickstarter and $75m from venture capital firms. Hesold his company to Facebookfor $2bn in 2014, when he was just 21 years old.\xe2\x80\x9cIf I grew up in \xe2\x80\x98da hood\xe2\x80\x99 it would make my story so much more interesting \xe2\x80\x93 if I had something to escape from,\xe2\x80\x9d he told theTelegraphin 2015. Instead, he grew up middle class in southern California, where he was homeschooled by his mother.

Photograph: Time magazineLuckey\xe2\x80\x99s public image \xe2\x80\x93 like his Time magazine cover \xe2\x80\x93 seems appealingly unpretentious. He wears sandals or goes barefoot at work, a detail repeated in most articles about him. He drives a2001 Honda. He is really, really into video games.He is not cool and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be.As virtual reality and Oculus have risen in stature in the technology world, Luckey has made gestures toward the higher purpose we like our tech moguls to embrace \xe2\x80\x93 the narrative about changing the world for the better.Facebookhas been \xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] the world more open and connected\xe2\x80\x9d. Google has been \xe2\x80\x9corganiz[ing] the world\xe2\x80\x99s information and mak[ing] it universally accessible and useful\xe2\x80\x9d.Luckey has spoken about the potential value of virtual reality foreducation, and VR boosters tend to hype its potential to increase human empathy by expanding our ability to experience other people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.Oculus Rift founder Palmer Luckey spends fortune backing pro-Trump 'shitposts'Read moreStill, at heart, Luckey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear as invested in the transformative possibilities of his technology as we might hope. Asked by theTelegraphwhat aspect of VR he was most excited about, he responded: \xe2\x80\x9cVideo games. I\xe2\x80\x99m a shallow person.\xe2\x80\x9dVideo games don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be shallow, and gamers don\xe2\x80\x99t all agree with GamerGate, but Luckey\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the Trump meme machine suggests that his investment in the social good of technology is indeed shallow.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it sounded like a real jolly good time,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Daily Beast about the shitposting organization.\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst part is that I bought into VR and Oculus bc it has the potential to change how people view the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s an empathy headset,\xe2\x80\x9d wroteone disappointed VR enthusiast on Reddit.\xe2\x80\x9cVR has the potential to make internet communication more heartfelt and real.

Photograph: RedditUsers and moderators of Reddit\'s newest default subforums have reacted in varying ways \xe2\x80\x93 from fighting back to opting out \xe2\x80\x93 after being thrust into the limelight as part of the site\'s recent redesign.The front page of the news and networking site\'s biggest community for women, r/TwoXChromosomes, was dominated for much of Friday and Saturday with fairly graphic posts about menstruation and toilet habits. This was the result of a protest by regular members who felt undermined by an influx of new \xe2\x80\x93 and not always entirely genuine \xe2\x80\x93 contributors.Meanwhile, moderators of r/dataisbeautiful, a subreddit devoted to data visualisation, tightened up the rules submitters have to follow, requiring original creations to provide the data source, and banning contributions from members who are not explicitly subscribed to the subreddit.The music forum r/listentothis, with the help of a large collection of automated moderation tools,has managed to keep its rules rigidly enforced. Bands with more than 500,000 listeners on last.fm and songs with more than a million views are automatically removed, as is anything that\'s not a song. But the submission rate on the forum has doubled and there has been a spike in spam, which the robots can\'t handle.Each is reacting to the influx of new members of the community brought by inclusion of their subreddits on the site\'s default list, to which all new members are automatically subscribed and which is shown to users who aren\'t logged in.TwoXChromosomes, for example, had 180,000 members subscribed as of last week, but over a course of an average month the reddit front page receives 100 million unique users.At their worst, those new members flood the subreddits with submissions out of character for the forums, which have often spent years building up codes of conduct and their own community norms. "There has never been a default sub that didn\'t suffer in quality, and there never will be,"says user LinuxLinuson the DataIsBeautiful subreddit. "It\'s a numbers game: we can report and downvote as much as we like, but unless you have 50 mods, the shitposting will overwhelm everything else, just as it has on every default sub."KaylaS,a user of TwoXChromosomes, agrees. "There were a few trolls and ignorant people on here before but most people on here were serious subscribers and there were enough of us to counteract them with downvotes and report. Not anymore. We can all say goodbye to a safe place on reddit for women. I know I won\'t feel comfortable here anymore."While most users only found out that their favourite subreddits were becoming default subs whenReddit announced it publiclyon Wednesday, the moderators of each sub were given advance warning \xe2\x80\x93 and the opportunity to decline. Some redditors, such as KaylaS, wish they\'d taken that chance, but others have placed their trust in the moderators."I know that a lot of people are afraid of the defaulting of the sub,"writes KennysConstitutional on r/listentothis"but\xe2\x80\xa6 we have very dedicated moderators who are resourceful and determined to keep this place from going to shit."But moderators can only do so much, particularly against an influx of users who are not so much clueless as actively hostile. That was the problem faced by TwoXChromosomes, which has to deal with being the most prominent space for women on a site known more for being the home of numerous communities of "men\'s rights" activists and "pick-up artists".Some members of those communities begrudged having a subreddit just for women included in the defaults, seeing it as an example of discrimination against men. Just hours after the change was instituted,users reported abuse in the private message systemof Reddit, something no moderator can prevent.But rather than being cowed, many users of TwoXChromosomes are fighting back; hence the rush of "TMI" posts. "For those of you not wanting to see girl-talk on your frontpage because we are "gross", you can unsubscribe," says the author of "Oh the period shits\xe2\x80\xa6" a front page post with 1144 comments and 1672 net upvotes."Serious question: is this how it normally is around here?"asked one new user in response."I\'ve never known TwoX to shy away from the more gnarly TMI [too much information] topics that women talk about, so in a way, yes,"confirmed another. "But I think we might be pulling out all the stops in retaliation."\xe2\x80\xa2Reddit shakes up the defaults again: which are the best of the new intake?TopicsRedditSocial networkingSocial mediaWomennewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this contentView all comments &gt;Order bynewestoldestrecommendationsShow252550100AllThreadscollapsedexpandedunthreadedLoading comments\xe2\x80\xa6Trouble loading?View more commentsMost popularUSElections 2020WorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleAbout usContact usComplaints &amp; correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms &amp; conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookTwitterAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsDatingDiscount CodesSupport The\xc2\xa0GuardianAvailable for everyone, funded by readersContributeSubscribeBack to top\xc2\xa9 2019 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It\'s like if reddit was entirely its lowest quality content.If anything it seems to support the idea that anonymous environments bring out the worst kind of discourse.  I get the draw of a place where people can be unfiltered without having to worry about their reputation, but in practice it doesn\'t seem to create a great environment for any interesting discussion.typon7 months agoPeople are so enamoured by 4chan precisely because it isn\'t like reddit. Reddit, Facebook or any social media platform that rewards users with up votes, karma, reputation, likes or whatever creates a system in which people want to please others and develop reputations they have to uphold. 4chan is free from those chains and people are able to freely throw ideas into the mix. This is why 4chan has been so instrumental in coming up thousands of memes that define internet culture today. Reddit, Facebook and others are usually consumers of those memes rather than generators.I know this is a massive generalization, but that\'s been my impression being on digg, reddit, Twitter and 4chan for 10 years now.The problem is that a lot of the original 4chan users either moved on or just grew up and at the same time 4chan got over taken by alt-light type folks. I still think the basic idea of 4chan has a lot to offer that maybe could be replicated on an other platform, with a fresh set of people.owlie7 months ago&gt;The problem is that a lot of the original 4chan users either moved on or just grew up and at the same time 4chan got over taken by alt-light type folks.This is relatable. I was a pretty notable figure on /mu/ for a few years, and my tripfriends WERE my social circle when high school couldn\'t do that for me. Then I went to college and realized how much toxicity it had instilled in me, and moved on.It\'s interesting to reflect on that bit of my teenage years!throwawaylolx7 months ago&gt;I was a pretty notable figure on /mu/Only Biotroll and CLT get to claim this status :Pdymk7 months agoAt one point, 4chan was the source of a lot of internet culture and memes, but that ship has firmly sailed.Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, and even Facebook are now massive generators of original content and memes.The alt-lite type folk were always on 4chan. Just only "recently" has the political atmosphere shifted in such a way that we have a word to describe that sort of ideology and behavior.cududa7 months agoThat is absolutely false. Shit tons of political memes and conspiracy theories picked up by the likes of Breitbart, Alex Jones, etc still originate theredymk7 months agoI didn\'t say their meme output dropped to zero. I said that other websites are the dominant force for generating the memes we see today.typon7 months agoI agree with you that 4chan isn\'t the meme generator place it used to be. But I would say that the memes produced on reddit, Twitter or Facebook are different qualitatively. They have much broader appeal usually (normie) than 4chan. But yea..4chan is not the cool subversive place it used to be any more. People make a huge difference... Platforms are not enough on their own. And the people have moved onmadeofpalk7 months agoBut you can look at the memes that we have today, \'image macros\' and their origins from things that started in places like 4chan.agumonkey7 months agoI don\'t mind principles or rules but I don\'t like what most websites have in place.4chan was completely unpredictable and unorganized; no tension was trying to make something out of it except for the people there. Something there made me like that. I never really used it except for a few readings once a year.. and I always like this raw side.

Be it a shitty situation at home (tons of foster kids on there in the old days), broke ass young adults, suicidally depressed, autistic, whatever, whoever just couldnotfit in, they had humans they could interact with, which is demonstrably imperative to human health.Bad actors would do bad shit there due to the very nature of the site. Probably, the misfits could have found some other, healthier, place to congregate. But they didn\'t, and so 4chan was important, to many people.It\'s a shame it got weaponized by bad actors. There was once a day when such attempts would be met with "4chan is not your personal army." Unfortunately, the bad actors got smart enough to figure out how to turn them into an army anyway.Beyond that, I believe it\'s important for social / cultural / political structures I disagree with to exist in small "gardens," left to their own devices - both as a living example of "yup, x or y doesn\'t work, go to 4chan to see what it results in," but also because sometimes itdoeswork, and it\'s important to keep those traditions alive.claudiawerner7 months agoI really can\'t get behind the idea that it\'s a disgusting place, even now. There are some parts that I was hesitant to use because it would drag me into arguments with right-wingers, but there were many other parts that were just really, really good. The kind of discussion that prevailed was often insightful (if usually short). On /mu/ and /lit/, the kind of people you don\'t want to be engaging with usually keep to their own threads, because they know their input is worthless in better threads. It is possible for me to have a good discussion about Marx (for instance) on /lit/ with minimal interference. This is an amazing feat considering how 4chan doesn\'t have the "walling" features that subreddits provide. That\'s often a bad thing but it\'s sometimes a good thing too.komali27 months agoIt doesn\'t have to always be disgusting, to be a disgusting place.The unabashed use of racial and LGBT slurs is disgusting. So is the gore raids, the frequent suggestions to self harm (regardless of the presence of "white Knights"), general misogyny, frequent jailbait content (moreso in the old days), shit like that.Not everything there is disgusting. Not everyone is disgusting. But, compared to, say, imgur or something, you are far more likely to come out of 4chan with a terrible taste in your mouth I would say.seatdrummer7 months agoYou are also able to come out of it with a different perspective you\'d never otherwise gain due to up and down voting being missing.A merit of 4chan is that you get exposed to content you don\'t like.newen7 months agoYep. It\'s incredible how you can have a reasonably intelligent discussion in 4chan, while in reddit and similar vote based sites, once the mob comes to visit the site, they take over and no one can have a good discussion anymore.gjs2787 months ago4chan boards are fine. there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with the free expression of ideas. you can respond back to any incorrect idea all you want.KozmoNau77 months agoYoucancertainly post thoughtful comments, but they will invariably be shouted down by shitposts and outright abuse. It\'s not worth it, because the 4chan hivemind doesn\'t want it. The boards are too hectic and posting moves too fast.zhte4157 months agoJudge much?komali27 months agoCare to elaborate? I was as much a member of the community as anyone else, I believe I\'m allowed an opinion on it.str33t_punk7 months agoThe romanticism comes from the fact that 4chan has been incredibly influential in internet history.Chaos is a ladder, as they say in GOT, and some of the best content out there has come from 4chan.The lack of identity and point system also brings out some of the most interesting conversation. I recommend checking out /mu or /lit (/b, /pol/, and /r9k are all containment boards). If you contrast the conversation on /mu and /lit with similar reddit boards (r/music - or even spin offs like r/hiphopheads - and r/books) you will find much more interesting and original content. I find the point system on reddit lends itself much closer to a \'hivemind\' where everyone ends up conforming to the same opinion, which makes things boringskurpaduhurrr7 months agoSame goes for HN. Even with throwaways, the point system serves as this \xe2\x80\x9ccorrective\xe2\x80\x9d barometer, that you\xe2\x80\x99re expected to notice, even care about, and supposed to strive toward.But perhaps most pathetically, even the moderators are brainwashed by it, as if the positivity trends of some mob are the smartest ruler to obey.So, what if I disagree with the mob, and what if I\xe2\x80\x99m right?Well, the eigenstate of schroedinger\xe2\x80\x99s cat tells us that there\xe2\x80\x99s some degree of probablity that excuses us from ever taking that bet, so you can eat this hellban and lap up the antikarma like it\xe2\x80\x99s the secretions of your wildest fantasy.Enjoy the vacuum of the echochamber. In space, no one can hear you scream.jodrellblank7 months ago[flagged]fnovd7 months agoThis is slightly meta, but I find it interesting that the person you\'re attacking is questioning the utility of a point-based system and yet that very system is trying to silence your speech rather than theirs. The mob wants you to know that refusing to question the mob is against the rules.dymk7 months agoThe mob wants to think it\'s self-critical when asked directly.But I dare the mob to be self-critical of some popularly held belief without the pretext of this meta commentary. HN can beveryone sided, and it shows in lots of discussions, from ads to piracy to language choices.jshevek7 months agoOr the mob simply didn\'t like their tone or phrasing.adrianN7 months agoI don\'t think it\'s good for communities when they became echo chambers and alienate people with different opinions.skurpaduhurr7 months agoRailing against trends is less a commentary against the premise of the site, and more a commentary against the emergent whims of groupthink.Points systems amplify the perception of groupthink, and getting karma stomped into a ban happens a lot.Getting banned for a greyed out comment is kind of lame, and I think a certain sort of darwinism, of letting vitriolic people express their contempt has utility.In other words, more people should develop a thick skin, and fewer people should be silenced. In theory, that sounds good, but obviously it can also go wrong, to let people bloviate too much.I think the solution is to permit the full stream but classify and sort the responses, but in most cases, NLP just isn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough to automate grouped selections of comments, so we get stuck with a one dimensional mechanical turk voting rank. Yay versus boo!I don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy the idea of AI submerging buried comments deepet, but trusting people to vote according to quality of discussion is a dubious gambit, and you really only get an edge detection doppler return revealing the joints of political fault lines, which gets old when holy wars guide many an opinion.smokeyj7 months agoThe principle still stands. Why care about points? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the motivating factor to remove displaying comment points on HN in the first place? Facilitating hive mentality?If everyone agrees with a comment it probably adds no value. If everyone disagrees it probably adds no value. Maybe interesting discussions should be sorted by controversial, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that would be a \xe2\x80\x9csafe space\xe2\x80\x9d.Tomte7 months agoThat\'s a fallacy. The best comments in HN aren\'t the "edgy" or controversial ones, they are the ones where someone shares information that I\'ve never seen somewhere else.Saying offensive things doesn\'t lift the level of discourse, no matter how much people who would love not to be downvoted complain about the "hive mind".smokeyj7 months ago[flagged]krapp7 months agoWhy are people whose views differ from your "the hive", but you, and those with whom you agree, are not?smokeyj7 months agoI guess being against censorship is inherently hypocritical given you\'re trying to censor the censors. I\'ll have to live with that hypocrisy.vivekd7 months agoIn a way that\'s 4chans strength.  The comments and threads that get most noticed are the ones with most replies - ie the most controversial ones.   Thats why Alexandria Ocasio Cortz is one of the most prominently posted figures on 4chans alt-light/pol/ boardeitland7 months ago&gt; Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that the motivating factor to remove displaying comment points on HN in the first place?lobste.rs shows points (and moderation logs and who invited who).It still feels much "safer" than HN, but I guess the real reason is because they are much stricter about what topics are accepted.Which means HN is more interesting to me but I also like lobste.rs a lot.windo117 months agoLet me pull up the front page of one of the "better" boards /lit/ right now and read literally the first post. It\'s for making fun of a woman\'s OKCupid profile. Here\'s a sampling of comments:"She\'s a pleb with a mental illness.""hello Jamal" (replying to someone who said they enjoy R&amp;B)"women are conformist by nature, is it really all that surprising?"Let\'s move to post 2: "Describe hell to me""Imagine a place that is really really really really really really really really really really gay.""dying to meet Hitler""A fat girl sits on your face and farts on you for the rest of eternity"Is this the place we should be romanticizing? This was all within about 90 seconds of opening the site. I spent a lot of time on 4chan when I was younger, specifically /mu/ and /lit/ and I think it was really bad for me and my mental health at the time. These communities are extremely toxic, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and more than anything, downright cruel.siedes7 months agoYou have to take the good with the bad in the case of 4chan. Consider that any thread can be bumped to the front page with a reply, and consider that when a new thread is created, one is pushed off page 10 and then disappeared/archived. 90 seconds after first opening 4chan or any similar imageboard do not tell you anything. Yes, if you randomly go on the front page of any board, it is not exactly weird to see low quality threads that were either just recently made or have been freshly bumped. And you do not know why the thread was bumped without going into it. It may have been a poster who came in to complain, or to shitpost inside of it because it was a shit thread anyway. This is just part of imageboard culture unlike other sites which actively hide all the bad from you. Unless a thread explicitly breaks rules, is completely unrelated to the respective board, or is cancerous in its own right, it won\'t be deleted right away unless it has some backlash either by live feedback from anons or reports. On 4chan, you see all the bad that comes along with the good. Or no good at all sometimes. Depends on whoever\'s posting that day and how they feel. It\'s free(as in freedom) and pretty great usually.windo117 months agoI used to spend alotof time on these boards, for years when I was younger. I know how it works, and I am familiar enough with 4chan to know that this language is common and normalized (calling people f-----s, n-----s, etc). /lit/ in particular I remember as being violently misogynistic (and a quick browse today confirms that). I\'m familiar with the culture, the "irony" that justifies this kind of language, all of it. I was immersed in it for a long time, I "get" it. And it\'s not OK.I think 4chan is an incredible, fascinating experiment, and I don\'t think all of it is trash or worthless, and it\'s true that not all boards are /b/. But it is undeniable that the overall culture is one of hostility, aggression, and cruelty, especially towards marginalized groups (not to mention the creepy sex stuff, which also pervades all boards). It\'s not a model for a healthy internet community by any means.Edit: OP was edited, want to add a bit:My overall assessment of 4chan is totally different: it is a cautionary tale of what free as in freedom on the internet actually looks like: a place where a few cynical teenage/early 20s white dudes may have a good time, while creating a culture totally devoid of empathy or inclusion for anyone else. A hotbed for lawlessness where violence and extreme ideologies fester and have real world consequences, the worst of the mid-2000s web.siedes7 months agoI don\'t deny that 4chan is a cesspit, but like I said, you have to take the good with the bad. From my experience, as a person who is of a minority race, as long as you do not mention your race, literally no one cares. You\'re perfectly welcome to join in on the shitposting. Back then and still today, it has been race and sexuality related bigotries, but 4chan would be happy to insult you in any other fashion as well if given the opportunity. But since those words still have power given to them by those who choose to be offended by those words, they are still by far the best weapon of choice for 4chan users to rally behind. Do I endorse it? No, but I\'m not against it either.While I don\'t think 4chan is a model for a healthy internet community, I believe the internet is healthier if 4chan exists than if it did not. Some say it is the last bastion of free speech on the internet and I would agree. I can\'t name any other place I would go to see what I see on the chan.mintplant7 months ago&gt; those who choose to be offendedThis is simply not how the brain works. "Taking offense" comes out of a mix of low-level mental responses and emotions, bubbling up into the conscious mind from below, rather than being the outcome of a top-down rational thought process which one could "choose" to switch off.zebraflask7 months agoThe whole site reminds me of teenagers who are trying too hard to act rebellious. The problem is that it apparently has a large enough audience that some adults find that kind of behavior acceptable.microwavecamera7 months agoIncredibly influential in internet history? We were doing all those things before reddit and 4chan.inertiatic7 months agoMemes in the form they took on on 4chan definitely weren\'t a thing before.The word meme itself was a sterile almost scientific term.I\'m not sure how old are you, but if you were around at the time this happened (early to mid 00s) and active on imageboards you would surely have noticed just how different the experience was.fingerlocks7 months agoMy memory is the word being used quite often as any \xe2\x80\x9ccontagious idea\xe2\x80\x9d. It started to became synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9ctired internet joke\xe2\x80\x9d in the late 90s with dancing baby, then cemented 2001 with the someone-set-us-up-the-bomb video.xorcist7 months agoSurely the memes of 4chan fame came directly from SA and related forums?kbenson7 months agoI think you\'re just noticing the more egregious examples which garner a lot of attention.  Quite a lot of original content that didn\'t have any other common place used to originate on 4chan.  Eventually a lot of it shifted to Reddit as Reddit came into being and gained in popularity, but there\'s a reason that some content (such as very short science fiction stories, or humorous explanations of DND sessions in "greentext") is archived in the form of screen capture images, and that\'s because one of the few places you could find this with a wide audience was on 4chan.I\'ve only ever been on 4chan a handful of times, and yes, the boards that people expect to be a clusterfuck are indeed a clusterfuck, but if you pay attention it\'s hard to discount the influence 4chan had on internet culture in benign ways as well.throwaway43897 months agoFrom the outside, looking in, people tend to mistake 4chan for /b/, (and more recently /pol/). It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to if someone decided to write off reddit, just because of the content on /r/funny.For one, I think /a/ - 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s anime board is still the largest, English speaking, Japanese culture board out there. There have been animators, authors and directors on /a/, albeit answering questions in broken English. And /a/, unlike /b/, or /pol/, tends to not put up shock crap and humor. Many of the smaller boards are also like this (with the exception of probably /tv/ and more recently /fit/)The format itself, when not overrun edgy teenagers, is like nothing else. Every post is given equal representation. It\'s designed to be ephemeral and there\'s tends to be a lot less community politics. I won\'t argue that the format lends itself to a bastion of quality - it\'s a lot of wading through waste to find something good. It\'s the double edge sword of not having a "karma" system. But when its good - it\'s good, and when it\'s weird it _weird_.I think the problem with 4chan has had recently was moderation. moot made all the rules and was the final arbiter in all things 4chan. What that meant was only moot could really ban a discussion topic without it being overreach by mods. moot coming out and saying \xe2\x80\x9cnaruto is allowed on /a/\xe2\x80\x9c or \xe2\x80\x9cgamer gate doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong on /v/\xe2\x80\x9c was the only real mediating force that could transform the community. If an anonymous mod did it, it would always be met with a meme mocking mods (\xe2\x80\x9che does it for free\xe2\x80\x9d)When moot was more active, defending everything you said with \xe2\x80\x9cfree speech\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a thing either. Mods could ban you whenever they wanted for mostly whatever they wanted and bans tended to be more public. This mod power had a special hidden power - it was harder to take over the community around some singular meme. Eventually a mod would ban because he was tired of seeing X, and that was the end of that (similar to what happened to gamer gate - even during gamer gate people of people complained that games journalism didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong on 8 of the 10 threads on /v/)I secretly wish for moot to come back and roll heads just to make things interesting. Currently I think a lot of threads get derailed because bait-politics gets injected into almost everything. Threads get derailed because of "someone who is tangentially related to the subject being discussed is a woman and/or minority and if you support X that means you hate America" type of posts. And I also just wish he\'d pop by and tell us how he\'s doing. I hope he\'s happy now.phowon7 months agoOutsiders to 4chan would probably also be surprised at the site-wide outpouring of genuine sadness, nostalgia and gratitude when moot announced that he was stepping down.c3534l7 months ago4chan was the punk rock of websites in an era of increasing corporatization of the internet. It was an incubator for internet culture before other websites took that mantle and ran with it (Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and even Facebook now fill a similar role).Sargos7 months agoI feel like you just haven\'t spent much time there. Lots of interesting discussions are to be had on a vast number of topics. Much of Internet culture originated there as well.I feel like 4chan has shown just how needed an anonymous forum is to experimentation and community.sl1ck7317 months agoIt shows people want the worst kind of discourse. You might not like it but if such a sizable community does its a shame it can\'t live on its own.Not everyone gets online to peruse HN or even learn anything at all and there isn\'t anything wrong with that.setr7 months agoWell no, it shows that people are willing to acceptsomeworthless discourse; but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it all is.It\xe2\x80\x99s the same as when you spend an hour trafing memes with your friends \xe2\x80\x94 its utterly worthless, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean all of your conversation looks like that. But anyone else who wanders in blindly might only see the meme trading and think that\xe2\x80\x99s all you do. In the context of 4chan, its just wandering into the wrong board (eg /b/), or the wrong thread, and thinking that was the only thing that happened round these parts. Like the whole hacker and gore thing came out of a single subcommunity, but became the public face of 4chan; but none of the other boards cared about it (although bots would randomly start getting through captcha and spam gore/loli porn, which most users simply hid or ignored. Some people praised the bots for keeping out the riffraff (those unwilling or unable to ignore things they dislike), but otherwise, they were far more an idea people had about 4chan and its users than the userbase actually did or supportedaquabeagle7 months agoI find it weird how many people are ok with 4chan but freak out about Gab.dymk7 months agoNot enough porn.huffmsa7 months agoThat\'s exactly what it is / was.

MilnerePubPDFprint4Chan,agonism,antagonism,civility,gender,identity,incivility,internet memes,irony,lulz,memes,race,reddit,social,trollingRyan M. MilnerCollege of CharlestonAbstract:4chan and reddit are participatory media collectives undergirded by a \xe2\x80\x9clogic of lulz\xe2\x80\x9d that favours distanced irony and critique. It often works at the expense of core identity categories like race and gender. However, the logic need not be entirely counterproductive to public discourse. Provided that diverse identities find voice instead of exclusion, these sites may facilitate vibrant, agonistic discussion instead of disenfranchising antagonism. In order to assess this potential for productive agonism, I undertook a critical discourse analysis of these collectives. Emphasising the image memes they produce, I evaluated discourses on race and gender. Both race and gender representations were dominated by familiar stereotypes and partial representations. However, while dissenting perspectives on race were repressed or excluded, dissenting perspectives on gender were vocalised and contested. The \xe2\x80\x98logic of lulz\xe2\x80\x99 facilitated both dominance and counter, each articulated with heavy reliance on irony and critique. This logic ambiguously balanced agonism and antagonism, but contestation provided sharper engagement than repression.Violentacrez and the Antagonistic Internet- 1 -\xe2\x80\x98A troll exploits social dynamics like computer hackers exploit security loopholes\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 (Adrian Chen, 2012 October 12)- 2 -In October 2012, reddit \xe2\x80\x93 a popular link aggregation service and public discussion forum \xe2\x80\x93 was embroiled in a prominent controversy. Adrian Chen, a journalist for the news site Gawker, had just revealed the \xe2\x80\x98offline\xe2\x80\x99 identity of Violentacrez, one of reddit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98most reviled characters but also one if its most beloved users\xe2\x80\x99 (Chen, 2012 October 12). Violentacrez, who Chen calls \xe2\x80\x98the biggest troll on the web\xe2\x80\x99, was responsible for reddit pages (called \xe2\x80\x98subreddits\xe2\x80\x99) like \xe2\x80\x98r/Jailbait\xe2\x80\x99 (sexualised photos of young girls) and \xe2\x80\x98r/Creepshots\xe2\x80\x99 (sexualised photos of women taken in public without their consent). Chen accuses Violentacrez of releasing \xe2\x80\x98an unending fountain of racism, porn, gore, misogyny, incest, and exotic abominations yet unnamed\xe2\x80\x99 to reddit. To Chen, Violentacrez \xe2\x80\x98hacked\xe2\x80\x99 social dynamics with his posts, exploiting the reddit collective for his own amusement.- 3 -The unmasking of Violentacrez (who turned out to be an office worker from Texas) inspired extensive debate about the nature and role of public discourse on reddit. Some condemned Chen for \xe2\x80\x98doxxing\xe2\x80\x99 Violentacrez, claiming that anonymity online is equivalent to a First Amendment right, and should not be undermined even when that right is used irresponsibly. Others countered that those posting to r/Creepshots hadn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered with consent; why should these posters be afforded more control of their mediated presence than the girls they exploited?- 4 -The debate stirred. Prominent subreddits like \xe2\x80\x98r/Politics\xe2\x80\x99 responded to Chen\xe2\x80\x99s article by banning links to Gawker\xe2\x80\x99s network of sites (including Jezebel, Gizmodo, and Kotaku). In response to that censorship, the metacommentary subreddit \xe2\x80\x98r/CircleJerk\xe2\x80\x99 began ONLY allowing Gawker network links. Accusations bounced back and forth between participants on \xe2\x80\x98r/MensRights\xe2\x80\x99 (labeled as \xe2\x80\x98a place for those who wish to discuss men\xe2\x80\x99s rights and the ways said rights have been infringed on\xe2\x80\x99) and \xe2\x80\x98r/ShitRedditSays\xe2\x80\x99 (which catalogues \xe2\x80\x98bigoted, creepy, misogynistic, transphobic, racist, homophobic\xe2\x80\x99 content from other subreddits). After much discussion \xe2\x80\x93 and little resolution \xe2\x80\x93 the controversy eventually quieted and Violentacrez retreated from prominence. Left in his wake were questions of identity, antagonism, voice, and exclusion in an ostensibly \xe2\x80\x98participatory\xe2\x80\x99 media collective.- 5 -The goal of this essay is an empirical assessment of these questions, focusing on content and tone in mediated public discourse. It is an analysis of \xe2\x80\x98the logic of lulz\xe2\x80\x99 persistent on a pair of ever-vibrant and increasingly prominent participatory media collectives: reddit and 4chan. As it did during the Violentacrez debate, this ironic and critical logic often antagonizes the core identity categories of race and gender, essentialising marginalised others. However, the logic can also be employed to \xe2\x80\x98troll\xe2\x80\x99 those categories themselves, at the expense of those invested in their rigid distinctions. Representations of race and gender will be analysed here, asking what ambivalent identity politics mean for mediated public participation.- 6 -Further, this logic is multimodal. It is expressed in both text and image, especially in the \xe2\x80\x98image memes\xe2\x80\x99 that are shared and remixed according to subcultural standards and individual creative expression on these sites. These images \xe2\x80\x93 and the discourses that surround them \xe2\x80\x93 starkly underscore the social dynamics evident in these collectives. I\xe2\x80\x99ve argued internet memes constitute a formal \xe2\x80\x98media lingua franca\xe2\x80\x99, bearing multiplicities of content to dispersed collectives (Milner, 2013a). They are also aesthetic manifestations of the logic of lulz. Image memes will be of central focus here, asking how they\xe2\x80\x99re employed in race and gender discourse on 4chan and reddit.- 7 -These twin emphases in mind, the following section will tie image memes to the logic of lulz in participatory media collectives. The sections after will analyse race and gender representations on 4chan and reddit, arguing that irony-laden communicative practices can both reinforce essentialisms and disrupt them. The final section will assess the merits and limitations of this logic and the practices it affords.- 8 -In the sections that follow, this essay evaluates racism and misogyny akin to that at the heart of the Violentacrez debate, and therefore presents racist and misogynistic discourses. Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s done in the service of critical assessment, reproducing these discourses continues their circulation, and therefore may continue to normalise their antagonisms and marginalisations. The goal here is a frank discussion of the ambivalent potential of mediated popular participation. Meaghan Morris ([1988] 2007) warns against cultural studies\xe2\x80\x99 tendencies to either emphasise \xe2\x80\x9cbanality and fatality\xe2\x80\x9d to the point of cynicism on the one hand or to \xe2\x80\x9cventriloquize the popular\xe2\x80\x9d until it becomes detached and benign on the other. The arguments on race, class, and gender herein could lean either way. Therefore, in this essay I will assess the voice and exclusion embedded in the banal, while attempting to avoid the trap of normalising and sterilising everyday antagonism. This in mind, I hope to highlight what Morris calls the \xe2\x80\x98aggressive, critical voices embedded in the grit and hardness of day to day life\xe2\x80\x99 (119).Memes, Lulz, and the Mediated Public- 9 -\xe2\x80\x98Internet memes\xe2\x80\x99 were a prominent part of the Violentacrez debate, as they now are with many discussions on participatory media collectives. Limor Shifman (2013) calls internet memes \xe2\x80\x98units of popular culture that are circulated, imitated, and transformed by internet users, creating a shared cultural experience\xe2\x80\x99 (367). The term can refer to oft-repeated phrases reappropriated from popular culture or subcultural history (like \xe2\x80\x98that escalated quickly\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98consequences will never be the same\xe2\x80\x99), to remixed videos (like YouTube parodies of \xe2\x80\x98Leave Britney Alone\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Gangnam Style\xe2\x80\x99), or to captured performative acts (like \xe2\x80\x98Tebowing\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Planking\xe2\x80\x99). However, image memes \xe2\x80\x93 small, still picture and animated GIF files extensively circulated, transformed, and incorporated into public discussion \xe2\x80\x93 are especially prolific in participatory collectives. These memes are easy to produce and can be agilely applied to diverse ends. Their ironic tone can quickly be employed for political or social debate, as I argued was the case during vibrant mediated conversation at the height of the \xe2\x80\x98Occupy Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99 protest movement (Milner, 2013b). Memes evidenced \xe2\x80\x98pop polyvocality\xe2\x80\x99; they were a pop cultural common tongue that facilitated the diverse engagement of many voices.- 10 -The ironic lingua franca predominant in memes can afford political edge. For instance, when reddit General Manager Erik Martin became a candidate forTIME Magazine\xe2\x80\x98s \xe2\x80\x99TIME100 Poll\xe2\x80\x99 in 2012 (TIMEStaff, 2012 March 29), participants on r/ShitRedditSays took the photo accompanying the nomination and remixed it to reflect a sentiment they found appropriate for the site. When controversies swirled around subreddits like r/Jailbait and r/Creepshots, the remixed image could then be specifically captioned (fig. 1, 2 &amp; 3).Figure 1: original image of reddit General Manager Erik Martin (whichTIMEitself took from reddit content). Click to Enlarge.Figure 2: An initial graphic manipulation of Figure 1. Click to EnlargeFigure 3: A subsequent \xe2\x80\x98image macro\xe2\x80\x99 caption used on r/ShitRedditSay -Click to Enlarge- 11 -Through this process, Erik Martin\xe2\x80\x99s image becomes a visual template; it becomes an \xe2\x80\x98image macro\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98stock character macro\xe2\x80\x99. From an established template, participants add unique text to make a joke. Macro humour derives from what Shifman (2011) calls \xe2\x80\x98incongruity\xe2\x80\x99, a clash between expectation and experience. These clashes often occur by first setting up the joke at the top of the image (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be associated with a site\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d in fig. 1). Next, the \xe2\x80\x98stock character\xe2\x80\x99 in the middle of the image (reddit\xe2\x80\x99s Erik Martin in fig. 1) provides a visual ellipsis, a pause between set up and punch line as readers scan past it and associate it with prior context and the specific text of the image. Last, the punch line rests at the very bottom of the text (\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6with no child porn on it\xe2\x80\x9d in fig. 1). As participants on r/ShitRedditSays and beyond created, circulated, and transformed these images, memetic remix afforded collective satire. These participants employed a logic of lulz to make political points.- 12 -Whitney Phillips (2012) says \xe2\x80\x98lulz\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 a derivation of \xe2\x80\x98lol\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98laughing out loud\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 labels on participatory collectives a detached and dissociated amusement at others\xe2\x80\x99 distress. Conceptually, it\xe2\x80\x99s the fundamental logic of trolling, a discursive strand Phillips says is wrought with the \xe2\x80\x98self-reflexive\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98absurdist\xe2\x80\x99, an \xe2\x80\x98opaque influence\xe2\x80\x99 on these sites. \xe2\x80\x98Both ubiquitous and invisible,\xe2\x80\x99 Phillips says, \xe2\x80\x98trolling permeates the online ecosystem\xe2\x80\x99 (2). Trolling performs the work of both \xe2\x80\x98cultural critic\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98cultural syphon\xe2\x80\x99, using humour and antagonism to rile angry responses and shift the content and tone of the conversation. However, as Phillips (2012) explains, even if trolling can be \xe2\x80\x98equal opportunity laughter\xe2\x80\x99, it still disproportionately targets minorities and women. This fits with Lisa Nakamura\xe2\x80\x99s (2002) observations about the exclusionary force of dominant race and gender identities in participatory media. The harshest test of the logic of lulz is how it is used to engage the most core of identities. If the tone of these representations is exclusionary, then there is cause for concern. However, if these identity categories intertwine in polyvocal public discourse, then perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s public utility in the logic of lulz.- 13 -In short, exclusionaryantagonismshould be less evident than adversarialagonism. Chantal Mouffe (2005, 2009) defines antagonism as \xe2\x80\x98relations between enemies\xe2\x80\x99, but sees a healthier agonism in \xe2\x80\x98relations between adversaries\xe2\x80\x99. She argues that \xe2\x80\x98conflict in liberal democratic societies cannot and should not be eradicated\xe2\x80\x99 (2009: 551). The collective reality of public life necessitates the existence of factionist discourse, since \xe2\x80\x98when dealing with political identities, which are always collective identities, we are dealing with the creation of an \xe2\x80\x98us\xe2\x80\x99 that can only exist by its demarcation from a \xe2\x80\x98them\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99 (550). Agonistic conflict is the core of a \xe2\x80\x98counterpublic\xe2\x80\x99 model of mediated public discourse (see Lincoln Dahlberg, 2011). Counterpublics succeed when they can utilise \xe2\x80\x98critical-reflexive spaces of communicative interaction\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98contest dominant discourses that frame hegemonic practice and meaning\xe2\x80\x99 (Dahlberg 861).- 14 -But counterpublic critique necessitates a lack of dominant abuse or repression of minority perspectives. To Mouffe (2005), agonism is achieved by embracing public participation that encourages adversarial \xe2\x80\x98pluralism\xe2\x80\x99, acknowledging the equal rights of disparate perspectives to clash. Participation must be premised on the \xe2\x80\x98values of liberty and equality for all\xe2\x80\x99 even if it also embraces \xe2\x80\x98dissent about their interpretation\xe2\x80\x99 (121). Antagonism rejects those values outright, pushing voices out of the public sphere. For the logic of lulz afford vibrant, agonistic public discourse, multiple perspectives and counter perspectives should be evident. Voice should be evident over exclusion, even if that voice is not monolithic in content or tone.- 15 -Analysing communicative specifics will illuminate public discourse in the participatory media collectives that afford both identity exclusion and pop polyvocality. The logic of lulz \xe2\x80\x93 and the trolling that most explicitly evidences it \xe2\x80\x93 reflects the ambivalent potential of this contested commons. To Kelly Bergstrom (2011) \xe2\x80\x98to troll is to have negative intents, to wish harm or at least discomfort on one\xe2\x80\x99s audience. To be trolled is to be made a victim, to be caught along in the undertow and be the butt of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s joke\xe2\x80\x99. To Phillips (2012) trolling need not be \xe2\x80\x98inherently regressive\xe2\x80\x99; it\xe2\x80\x99s all about \xe2\x80\x98who uses the tools\xe2\x80\x99. Gabriella Coleman (2010) says the mischievous engagement of the mediated \xe2\x80\x98trickster\xe2\x80\x99 may serve a political purpose. Violentacrez is an extreme example of Bergstrom\xe2\x80\x99s (2011) harmful antagonistic troll, but Coleman frames trolls in more forgiving \xe2\x80\x93 if not wholly prosocial \xe2\x80\x93 terms:- 16 -cunning, deceit, lying, provocateur, mischief, audacious, thief, play, shrewdness, audacity, grotesque, over the top, appetite, shocking, fun, delight, wit, trap, subversive, ability, wanderer.- 17 -By this conception, the practice of trolling may serve public ends, creating discomfort, but also productive engagement with political adversaries and othered identities.- 18 -The rest of this essay will apply these questions on memes, identity, and lulz to representations of race and gender on 4chan and reddit. Its ultimate question is how exclusion and voice operate within the logic of lulz.4chan, Reddit, and Analysing Lulz- 19 -For a broader project on mediated cultural participation, in 2011 and 2012 I undertook an analysis of participatory media collectives where discussion online is at its most vibrant, disembodied, and raw. Collecting discourse most heavily between April and December 2011, I wove a corpus of thousands of discussion threads and their accompanying images. Drawing from that project, this essay addresses two prominent, interrelated, yet distinct participatory collectives: 4chan and reddit. On 4chan and reddit, members of the mediated public consistently employ a logic of lulz. As they do, participants on each site extensively represent race and gender in their discourse.- 20 -4chan is a notorious \xe2\x80\x98image board\xe2\x80\x99 network. While the site is divided into a multiple boards \xe2\x80\x93 forums for a multitude of interests from anime to fitness \xe2\x80\x93 its \xe2\x80\x98random\xe2\x80\x99 board (known as \xe2\x80\x98/b/\xe2\x80\x99 for its URL: 4chan.org/b/) is the most active and raw. /b/ is built on the premise of anonymity. Participants are not required to post with any pseudonym or credentials, and most don\xe2\x80\x99t. Threads are not archived (becoming inaccessible as new threads push them away) and are scantly organised on the barebones site. The board comes with a boilerplate warning at the top of its page, which reminds participants that trolling is its guiding aesthetic. \xe2\x80\x98The stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood,\xe2\x80\x99 the warning has long read. \xe2\x80\x98Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact\xe2\x80\x99.- 21 -In the shadow of this warning, 4chan has developed an \xe2\x80\x98anything goes\xe2\x80\x99 reputation. It is avant-garde or lewd, depending on the person being asked and the thread being read. This environment of anonymous public discourse means extensive engagement with race and gender identities.- 22 -Reddit \xe2\x80\x93 the epicenter of the Violentacrez debate \xe2\x80\x93 is increasingly notable in mediated public discourse. Like 4chan, it also contains boards (its subreddits) devoted to multiple topics. In reddit\xe2\x80\x99s case these subreddits are innumerable, since participants create them. This affords the ability for both r/ShitRedditSays and r/MensRight to exist in the same media landscape, and operate within a similar lingua franca, even if each subreddit can develop its own unique memes, norms, and discourses.- 23 -On reddit, new posts \xe2\x80\x93 and comments within those posts \xe2\x80\x93 can be \xe2\x80\x98upvoted\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98downvoted\xe2\x80\x99 by other users. Upvotes mean \xe2\x80\x98karma points\xe2\x80\x99 for posters, quantifying their contribution to the site. The highest-voted comments reach the top of the post, the highest-voted responses to those comments reach the top position under parent comments. The highest-voted posts reach the tops of their subreddits. Those top posts are seen on the \xe2\x80\x98front page\xe2\x80\x99 of the site, based either on the subreddits a participant subscribes to, or, if not logged in, by a rank of default subreddits. Reddit tends to inspire complex and intricate discussion, but its upvote system can potentially contribute to a \xe2\x80\x98tyranny of the masses\xe2\x80\x99, pressing down unpopular perspectives until they\xe2\x80\x99re hidden from default view.- 24 -Taken together, 4chan and reddit are each vibrant sites of mediated public discourse. They each prominently feature a logic of lulz and extensively engage with race and gender identities. All this means that they are exemplary research sites in an analysis of how social dynamics are hacked and identities collide in participatory media collectives.- 25 -In order to assess the multimodal commentary and representations on these sites, I have employed critical discourse analysis (Ruth Wodak and Michael Meyer, 2009). Critical discourse analysis is sensitive to the subtle and powerful relations between communication created (in all its multimodal dimensions) and ideology reinforced. Exclusionary, dominant ideologies discursively undermine broad cultural participation. Antagonistic ideology is antithetical to agonistic engagement. Assessing micro-level representations regarding race and gender provides a means for evaluating identity antagonism on these sites. The next two sections will undertake that assessment.Race, Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law, and Ambivalent Irony- 26 -Participatory media collectives have, historically, been white and privileged. In Lori Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s (2002) analysis of a \xe2\x80\x98Multiuser Domain\xe2\x80\x99 called BlueSky MUD, she finds whiteness is assumed unless explicitly stated otherwise, as is class cohesion. Likewise, Nakamura (2002) finds that in Excite chat communities:- 27 -The organizing identity does not include \xe2\x80\x98white\xe2\x80\x99 as a category; it is not on the menu at all. This omission is a disturbing example of the colonialist or imperialist gaze that sets up a racial other; whiteness is defined by its invisibility rather than its presence. The racial category of \xe2\x80\x98whiteness\xe2\x80\x99 is assumed to be a default option, thus creating a guided reading of the web that assumes that the reader is white. (105)- 28 -Ronald Jackson, Chang Shin, and Keith Wilson (2000) call whiteness a \xe2\x80\x98constructed centrality\xe2\x80\x99. The problem is that \xe2\x80\x98if whiteness is unmarked, it becomes distributed throughout social spaces and eventually functions as a \xe2\x80\x98universal insider\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99 (72). Because of this:- 29 -White people do not have to change who they are, how they talk, or how they behave. The talk and behavior of whites occupy a legitimised cultural space of social interaction, in which the identity of whiteness is acknowledged as normal and standard. (82)- 30 -Kendall (2002) finds whites have similar statuses on BlueSky. BlueSky participants defend their lack of racism by arguing they hardly notice if anyone they talk to is \xe2\x80\x98black\xe2\x80\x99. After all, how could they in a \xe2\x80\x98disembodied\xe2\x80\x99 online environment? But \xe2\x80\x98in these statements, the ultimate test of whether race matters online is the ability of black people to pass unnoticed as black. This emphasises the presumed desirability of hiding blackness and the assumption that people online are white\xe2\x80\x99 (210). It also boils race down to an easy binary: white or black, white or not white.- 31 -This constructed centrality is why a logic of lulz can reinforce oppressive ideologies, and repress minority value in the discourse. Michael Billig (2001) analyses how KKK joke sites support oppressive ideology with antagonistic humour. Because of this, \xe2\x80\x98the person finding the joke funny is implicitly accepting these stereotyped assumptions about the nature of the other\xe2\x80\x99 (277). Phillips (2012) finds similar practices in her analysis of 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/. Here, participants on both 4chan and reddit employed stereotypes for quick shortcuts to ironic humour. Further, racial representations were partial, and privileged the constructed centrality of whiteness without much contestation from participants.- 32 -Race was constructed on these sites multimodally, commonly mixing image and text in representations. For instance, one image macro series, called Successful Black Man, was particularly popular on reddit.[1]Like other image macros (see fig. 1, fig. 5), Successful Black Man is at its core a visual template. From this template, participants add unique text to make a joke. The macro is derived from a photo on the stock image website ShutterStock entitled \xe2\x80\x9cHandsome African American business man dressed in a black suit\xe2\x80\x9d. In the Successful Black Man macros the image inspired, a racist premise is established in the top clause of the added text; the bottom clause inverts that premise to deliver the punch line. \xe2\x80\x98These streets are mine\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 the top clause in one example reads; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\xa6investing in residential development is a great idea\xe2\x80\x99, reads the bottom clause.- 33 -Steeped in stereotype, Successful Black Man could further ingrain inegalitarian representations (e.g., \xe2\x80\x98You want to get iced\xe2\x80\xa6tea after another round of golf?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98I do not tip\xe2\x80\xa6less than 20 percent\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t read\xe2\x80\xa6this newspaper without my coffee\xe2\x80\x99). Familiarity with racist tropes is necessary to get the joke. If common perceptions that blacks are uneducated, cheap, and violent didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, neither would Successful Black Man. The name of the macro itself creates a racially-presumptuous association. If a black man is successful, he requires a modifier in front of his name to set him apart from a \xe2\x80\x98normal\xe2\x80\x99 black man. He\xe2\x80\x99s novel enough to premise a joke. Successful Black Man is the exception that proves the rule. The title makes apparent invisible associations between blackness and a lack of \xe2\x80\x98success\xe2\x80\x99 (defined narrowly and materialistically). It also assumes a readership likely to see an \xe2\x80\x98other\xe2\x80\x99 in Successful Black Man.- 34 -On the other hand, the macro \xe2\x80\x93 in its play on stereotypes \xe2\x80\x93 might undermine them. The turn of phrase that comes with the second clause punch line lampoons tendencies to unproblematically accept negative representations. The humourous incongruity \xe2\x80\x98works\xe2\x80\x99 because dominant cultural assumptions lead readers astray. Stereotypes ensure that the class comfort or social responsibility in the second clause creates a clash. That clash works as what Christian Burgers, Margot van Mulken, and Peter Jan Schellens (2012) label an \xe2\x80\x98irony marker\xe2\x80\x99, a \xe2\x80\x98meta-communicative clue\xe2\x80\x99 that helps readers understand an utterance as ironic. The punch line functions as a \xe2\x80\x98reversal of valence between the literal and intended meaning\xe2\x80\x99 (292) of the set up. Readers are trolled by the first clause in the macro, and the bait and switch in the second clause reverses a dominant discourse. The mischief reminds us \xe2\x80\x93 in a small way \xe2\x80\x93 to not take all stereotypes at face value.- 35 -As memetic remix affords the freedom to apply creativity to multiple ends, less ambiguous examples of racism existed on 4chan and reddit. 4chan in particular had a tendency toward racist discourse. On 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/ board, broader social conventions regarding race were antagonised for commentary or humour. In discussions of race, polite dynamics were hacked for reaction and play in ways seemingly inconsistent with Mouffe\xe2\x80\x99s (2005) criteria for inclusive agonism.- 36 -While many racial identities were othered, people of African descent bore the brunt of the critique. For instance, in a /b/ thread entitled Community College Negro, racism was the punch line, not the premise. The thread birthed a macro that inverts Successful Black Man, using a different stock image of another black male. This stock character is younger, and smiling in front of a row of lockers. The same juxtaposition between top clause and bottom clause exists as in Successful Black Man, but here it\xe2\x80\x99s used to convey underachievement and deviance (e.g., \xe2\x80\x9814 different scholarships..1.3 GPA\xe2\x80\x99). The macro spawned dozens of transformations in its single thread (e.g., \xe2\x80\x98went to college\xe2\x80\xa6just to sell drugs out of dorm room\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98failing me\xe2\x80\xa6is racist\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98library quiet floor\xe2\x80\xa6yelling at La\xe2\x80\x99Shonda\xe2\x80\x99). Successful Black Man conveys what Burgers, van Mulken, and Schellens call \xe2\x80\x98ironic blame\xe2\x80\x99; the macro begins with a \xe2\x80\x98negative\xe2\x80\x99 set up before a \xe2\x80\x98positive\xe2\x80\x99 reversal. Community College Negro is \xe2\x80\x98ironic praise\xe2\x80\x99; it begins with a positive set up before a reversal to a social negative. The second clause incongruity brings the punch line back to stereotype, not away from it.- 37 -On 4chan, this racism was sometimes \xe2\x80\x98memetic\xe2\x80\x99 itself. It was the stable core by which participants creatively remixed, displaying technological and subcultural literacy. For instance, one 4chan thread proposed readers \xe2\x80\x98build their fort\xe2\x80\x99 based on the original image in figure three.http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig17-300x284.jpg300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /&gt;Figure 4: A template posted to 4chan, calling for remix. The premise assumes that participants are white, and that interaction with the uniform minority masses is undesirable.- 38 -The challenge was for participants to use proficiency and creativity in editing and illustrating to fill in the space between the white \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99 and a horde of threatening minorities. Racism became the premise for a memetic game. Most solutions played on prevalent stereotypes (e.g., putting a child of African descent in front of the minorities to scare of absentee fathers; inserting a sign for \xe2\x80\x98Wite Wimmins, Fryin\xe2\x80\x99 Chikins, n watermelons\xe2\x80\x99 with an arrow pointing the other way; a sign that reads \xe2\x80\x98jobs\xe2\x80\x99 here in front of the \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99 character). These images were premised on zenophobic essentialisms of a homogenized outgroup. However, the consensus \xe2\x80\x98winner\xe2\x80\x99 of the thread (fig. 5) did not rely on stereotypes as much as portray the most complex fort from any invading threat.http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig20-300x187.jpg300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;Figure 5: A remix on the premise established in figure two. For this poster, the threat was sufficient enough to merit multiple towers, lasers, underground bunkers, and solid steel reinforcement.- 39 -In the thread, a racist premise was used to encourage humorous contribution. This premise reinforced oppressive ideologies, as was the case in Billig\xe2\x80\x99s (2001) study. 4chan posters operated in an environment where racial stereotypes were an understood and largely unchallenged assumption.- 40 -This unchallenged assumption represents a communicative blur inherent to the logic of lulz. The line between playful (if antisocial) irony, satire, and parody and \xe2\x80\x98earnest\xe2\x80\x99 racism is difficult to differentiate. Looking at the artifacts alone \xe2\x80\x93 and even the threads that accompany them \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to gauge intent. The logic of lulz was prevalent enough to blanket a considerable amount of antagonistic discourse in these collectives. The posts above could be the expressions of \xe2\x80\x98genuine\xe2\x80\x99 racists; they might also be downplayed as \xe2\x80\x98just for the lulz\xe2\x80\x99, a troll on \xe2\x80\x98politically correct\xe2\x80\x99 sensibilities. The difficulty in separating \xe2\x80\x98ironic\xe2\x80\x99 antagonism from \xe2\x80\x98earnest\xe2\x80\x99 antagonism is prevalent enough that it comes with a name in these collectives: Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law.- 41 -According to the participatory media reference site, Know Your Meme (\xe2\x80\x98Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law\xe2\x80\x99, undated) Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law \xe2\x80\x98is an internet axiom which states that it is difficult to distinguish extremism from satire of extremism in online discussions unless the author clearly indicates his/her intent\xe2\x80\x99. It was named for a 2005 forum thread on Creationism where a poster going by Poe declared that \xe2\x80\x98without a winking smiley or other blatant display of humor, it is utterly impossible to parody a Creationist in such a way that someone won\xe2\x80\x99t mistake for the genuine article\xe2\x80\x99. The term has become a way for participants to express confusion or ambivalence to seemingly antagonistic content. Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law \xe2\x80\x93 and the ambiguity it represents \xe2\x80\x93 indicates the difficulty in parsing out \xe2\x80\x93 within the logic of lulz \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98ironic\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98legitimate\xe2\x80\x99 identity antagonism.- 42 -Even /b/\xe2\x80\x99s infamous boilerplate warning is subject to Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law. The boilerplate claims that \xe2\x80\x98the stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehood. Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact\xe2\x80\x99. In early 2013, a participant on the subreddit dedicated to collecting 4chan content, r/4chan, posted an alleged suicide note from a pilot. The pilot promised that the suicide would come as a plane crash during a full flight. Participants in the thread wondered if the crash would really occur. When one poster cited the boilerplate warning as evidence the suicide clearly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, another responded by asking \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t seriously believe that cop-out disclaimer is always true, do you?\xe2\x80\x99 The discussion turned to difficulties in parsing out the \xe2\x80\x98bullshit\xe2\x80\x99 on 4chan. No matter the message, participants in these collectives lived in the shadow of Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law.- 43 -Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law is born from an ambiguous \xe2\x80\x98stance\xe2\x80\x99. Shifman (2013) argues that beyond content (what a meme says) and form (how a meme looks), we must consider its stance (\xe2\x80\x98information memes convey about their own communication\xe2\x80\x99, 367). How memes stand in relation to each other and broader discourses is revealed in their \xe2\x80\x98participation structures\xe2\x80\x99 (which voices are included and silenced), their \xe2\x80\x98keying\xe2\x80\x99 (the tone and style they adopt), and their \xe2\x80\x98communicative function\xe2\x80\x99 (whether its emotive, phatic, poetic, etc.). Seemingly racist content or form may be an attempt to \xe2\x80\x98key\xe2\x80\x99 satire through a hyperbolic, antagonistic tone, but may also reinforce unequal participation structures in doing so. The banal can carry both simultaneously. When content and form are so grounded in lulz, communicative function becomes ambiguous.- 44 -Indeed, it may not even be possible or helpful to try to separate \xe2\x80\x98true\xe2\x80\x99 identity antagonism in these collectives from antagonism \xe2\x80\x98just for the lulz\xe2\x80\x99. As Patricia Lange (2006) argues about \xe2\x80\x98flaming\xe2\x80\x99 (expressions of directed anger online in some ways a vernacular ancestor to trolling), declaring content a \xe2\x80\x98true troll\xe2\x80\x99 would require knowing both communicative intent and public reception. In the absence of either, we only have best-guess speculations. Hence, Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law.- 45 -The blur between irony and earnestness makes room for discourse otherwise impermissible. The logic of lulz combined with the repression of alternative perspectives meant there was a free use of racist language and imagery on 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/ board. Epithets more broadly impermissible were not off limits. Rampant use of the racial slurs on 4chan may have just been \xe2\x80\x98for the lulz\xe2\x80\x99, but it still represented a hacked social dynamic, one that favoured a white centrality. Racist discourses helped establish a participation structure premised on repressions of diverse voice.- 46 -But derivation of these slurs was also common on /b/, and may have perhaps keyed less antagonism. For instance, \xe2\x80\x98Nigga\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 with the \xe2\x80\x98soft a\xe2\x80\x99 of the ingroup \xe2\x80\x93 was often used on 4chan (see fig. 6). 4chan consistently reappropriated hip-hop vernacular. However, the joke in figure four comes from an incongruity that reinforces stereotypes, from associating an unlikely and ill-fitting source with the phrase. The term was often placed in macros over images of white men, underscoring its irony. As in Lange\xe2\x80\x99s (2006) case, reading intent is difficult given the ambiguous logic of the forum.Figure 6: An image of Pope John Paul II annotated with slang. The term\xe2\x80\x99s use might have been a nod to the \xe2\x80\x98coolness\xe2\x80\x99 of black terminology (along with common phrases like \xe2\x80\x98haters gonna hate\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98u mad\xe2\x80\x99).- 47 -Still, overtly racist discourse was prevalent on 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/; minorities were consistently marked for their minority status. In the case of people of African descent, those markings relied on stereotype (e.g. criminality, stupidity, and savage masculinity). Even if Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law and Lange remind us it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to assess ideological intent in discourse, racist labels and attributions still discursively trapped a minority identity through antagonistic stereotype. Like the \xe2\x80\x98build your fort\xe2\x80\x99 thread (figs. 4, 5), their stance does the discursive work of separating a human \xe2\x80\x98us\xe2\x80\x99 from a savage \xe2\x80\x98them\xe2\x80\x99.- 48 -The tone of this discourse precluded the adversarial encounter Mouffe (2005) finds so essential to productive agonism. The discourse cast an enemy. In the voices excluded, in the humour employed, and in perspectives forwarded, an outgroup was consistently implied. Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law or no, lulz or no, the discourse was antagonistic. Further, it was antagonistic to an outsider counterpublic not vocally present to counter.- 49 -Stereotypes were levelled against majority populations on 4chan too. However, in line with Nakamura\xe2\x80\x99s (2002) findings, they implied the white and Western are the invisible insider. For instance, in common threads about differences between Europe and America (lines drawn along the two dominant population centres on the site), Americans were critiqued for being unintelligent or overweight, Europeans for being weak or pretentious. These critiques, even if they featured disparaging images of people with light skin, were levelled at national differences, rather than racial differences. The races of minorities were emphasised and critiqued explicitly; critiques of whites did not typically emphasise race.- 50 -It may be easy to dismiss 4chan as anomalous, given its level of explicit racism. On reddit, racial discussion was less antagonistic and less explicit. Still, race was a marked category for minorities in reddit image memes and was an invisible category for whites. Instead, whites were often used to stand in for the class comfortable. One example of such class critique popular on reddit is a macro called Sheltering Suburban Mom (fig. 7) based on an image of romance novel writer Carly Phillips.[2]There is no clear indication how she became associated with the meme.http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig37-259x300.jpg259w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /&gt;Figure 7: Sheltering Suburban Mom, an image macro series. The macro series \xe2\x80\x93 whose name marks her class status, not her race \xe2\x80\x93 is the macro manifestation of the stereotypical, detached suburbanite.- 51 -Sheltering Suburban Mom is the prototypical cul-de-sac Christian, a socially-conservative, white, middle-class American who does not see the hypocrisies she posits (e.g., \xe2\x80\x98supports war on drugs\xe2\x80\xa6can\xe2\x80\x99t live without valium\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98claims not to be racist\xe2\x80\xa6tells son he can\xe2\x80\x99t date a black girl\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98pro life\xe2\x80\xa6unless it\xe2\x80\x99s her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s baby\xe2\x80\x99). The macro critiques a political and social class sheltered from complex inequalities. However, it reinforces the invisibility of dominant whiteness in its critique of class.- 52 -In the case of another popular macro, called High Expectations Asian Father, racial minority and class comfort both exists in a single portrayal.[3]However, race is the marked category. The stereotypical high expectations of Asian parents are skewered in the macro (e.g., \xe2\x80\x98Facebook?\xe2\x80\xa6why don\xe2\x80\x99t you face book and study?\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98Asian with no A\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6sin\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98B+ on blood test?\xe2\x80\xa6failure run through veins\xe2\x80\x99). The emphasis is predominantly on education, a class mobility concern, but race is the marked attributive category. Despite the class emphasis of the content, the title of the macro and the nonstandard English often applied as part of the joke foreground race, not class. While racism may not have been overt on mainline reddit, its discourses still marked race for minorities and made it invisible for whites.- 53 -Racial representations on 4chan and reddit had their differences, but operated under similar logics. The racism on 4chan was more explicit, but reddit also perpetuated a white centrality. Both worked to repress difference. A lack of multiple voices engaging \xe2\x80\x93 even in conflict \xe2\x80\x93 meant one-sided public discourse. The logic of lulz was employed partially and exclusively, and even with Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law casting doubt on the authenticity of the antagonism, the discourse itself was antagonistic. The next section will assess gender representations on these collectives, which evidenced heavy counterpublic contestation.Gender, r/ShitRedditSays, and the Arts of Making Do- 54 -Along with being white, participatory media collectives have also historically been male-dominated, both in population and in discourse. These spaces have therefore been masculine, if uniquely masculine. As Charlie Gere (2002) explains:- 55 -The early hackers at MIT and Stanford established one of the central archetypes of computing subculture, which continues to this day, that of the intellectually advanced but socially and sexually awkward male, who is prepared to devote most of his time to an engagement with the possibilities of digital technology, to the exclusion of almost anything else. (132)- 56 -Likewise, Kendall (2002) says that \xe2\x80\x98since the 1980s, the previously liminal masculine identity of the nerd has been rehabilitated and partly incorporated into hegemonic masculinity\xe2\x80\x99 (81). Kendall (2002) analyses how participants on the BlueSky MUD joke about their chances with women. She finds that \xe2\x80\x98the joke is intended to be on the participants themselves, regarding their nonhegemonic masculinity, but women are the ultimate butts of the joke\xe2\x80\x99 (87). Women are still detached objects, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re unattainable ones. Even in these jokes \xe2\x80\x93 meant to be commentary on atypical masculinity \xe2\x80\x93 inequality is discursively reproduced.- 57 -The problem is masculine forms are, as with race, the constructed centrality dominant in mediated collectives, while feminine forms are the marked minority and \xe2\x80\x98thereby highlight the femininity of the person as an essential aspect\xe2\x80\x99 (Klaus Fiedler and Jeannette Schmid, 2001: 264). Such demarcations can mean a hostile environment for marginalised groups, thus souring participatory potential. In this way, a cycle continues which normalises partial forms of understanding. Engaging in these collectives often means performing masculinity, thus embedding the ideologies further.- 58 -The discourse that \xe2\x80\x98The Internet\xe2\x80\x99 is a male space persists, despite the fact that the number of women and men \xe2\x80\x98online\xe2\x80\x99 has been balanced as far back as 2000 (Nakamura, 2002). Phillips (2012) finds the male gaze predominates 4chan, and reddit\xe2\x80\x99s similar reputation for misogyny came out during the Violentacrez debate. Both reddit and 4chan were prone to gender antagonisms. However, gender was also the subject of explicit agonistic discussion. Partial representations of gender were met with contestation from participants explicitly identifying as female. This meant hostile argument, but also agonistic engagement.- 59 -Engagement did mean contesting a dominant masculine stance. Gendered language marked females similar to how racial language marked minorities. The phrase \xe2\x80\x98bitches love\xe2\x80\x99 was commonly remixed in image memes. It quotes an episode of the showThe Boondockswhere a character is texting and says \xe2\x80\x98I sent that bitch a smiley face\xe2\x80\xa6bitches love smiley faces\xe2\x80\x99. In memes, it was often applied to male voices like Spider-Man (\xe2\x80\x98I spun that bitch a web\xe2\x80\xa6bitches love webs\xe2\x80\x99), William Shakespeare (\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m writing that bitch a sonnet\xe2\x80\xa6bitches love sonnets\xe2\x80\x99), George Washington (\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give those bitches freedom\xe2\x80\xa6bitches love freedom\xe2\x80\x99). These male characters all somewhat dismissively go about their standard business in order to impress some vague and denigrated female. Other examples of gendered language were more antagonistic (see fig. 8).http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig50-296x300.jpg296w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /&gt;Figure 8: An annotation of a 1788 painting by Jacques-Louis David entitled Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and His Wife. The annotation frames portrait with dismissiveness and exasperation, the hovering female in the image is distracting the male from his rational pursuit. She\xe2\x80\x99s told to \xe2\x80\x98get the fuck out (GTFO)\xe2\x80\x99 so he can do his science.- 60 -Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law haunted gender antagonisms on the site as much as partial representations of race. The caption in figure eleven could be satirising a perceived misogynistic tone of the original work; it could also be adding a layer of sexism less evident without the text. Many examples are hard to brush off as \xe2\x80\x98just lulz\xe2\x80\x99 (see fig. 9).http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig53-300x240.jpg300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /&gt;Figure 9: a two-layered \xe2\x80\x98Demotivational poster\xe2\x80\x99, a play on the aesthetics of common \xe2\x80\x98motivational posters\xe2\x80\x99 that frame a picture in black and offer a motivational phrase in white text under it. The 4chan image offers a pair of misogynistic statements. In this Demotivational, a statement against domestic violence is met with dismissive derision twice over. The effect is jarring. The original image \xe2\x80\x93 and the statement it makes against domestic violence \xe2\x80\x93 is doubly muted.- 61 -The participation structures imbedded in antagonistic memes \xe2\x80\x93 marking women for gender, issuing authoritarian commands, and applying denigrating labels \xe2\x80\x93work toward exclusion (\xe2\x80\x98back to the kitchen\xe2\x80\x99 was a common phrase; one annotated image reads \xe2\x80\x98if you watchCinderellabackwards, it\xe2\x80\x99s about a woman who learns her place\xe2\x80\x99). That these images reflect the dominant discourse \xe2\x80\x93 the banal standard \xe2\x80\x93 means irony can shelter bigotry. Morris ([1988] 2007) says banality intertwines \xe2\x80\x98lordly pronouncement\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98mimetic popular performance\xe2\x80\x99 (143). Predominant inequalities are reinscribed in everyday interactions. Lulz or no, 4chan and reddit were wrought with identity antagonism.- 62 -Many image memes portrayed women as stupid, irrational, and inconsistent. A macro series called Woman Logic plays on perceptions of hypocrisy in how women think.[4]The incongruity in each is premised on an ironic connection between women\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98logic\xe2\x80\x99 and supposedly illogical statements (e.g., \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t want guys to look at my ass\xe2\x80\xa6wear shorts that have words on them\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m so fat!\xe2\x80\xa6wait for compliments\xe2\x80\x99; \xe2\x80\x98pluck your eyebrows out\xe2\x80\xa6draw them back on\xe2\x80\x99). A common image used in the macro features a young, blonde, white girl staring off and lifting her hand up as if to say \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal?\xe2\x80\x99. The macro contrasts how \xe2\x80\x98women\xe2\x80\x99 reason and the understood norm of \xe2\x80\x98sound\xe2\x80\x99 logic, the invisible masculine.- 63 -These images key a masculine participation structure; the constructed centrality is male. This occurred in conversation as well. On 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/ board, it was common practice to tell a female participant posting her picture to also show \xe2\x80\x98tits or GTFO [get the fuck out]\xe2\x80\x99. In one annotated image, a shot of Vito Corleone from the film The Godfather is overlayed with the following command:- 64 -you come to us, hat in hand, with your story of gaia-faggotry and ask for our attention. and yet you do not show the proper respect and offer neither tits or a tasty sammich. the godfather says GTFO.- 65 -The oft-repeated warrant for the demand is that \xe2\x80\x98there are no girls on the internet\xe2\x80\x99, so a female wanting to make her gender identity salient during a discussion must make it physically explicit. The demand reifies the board as a male space. The assumption is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re specifically referring to your female gender (or \xe2\x80\x98your story of gaia-faggotry\xe2\x80\x99), then you must only be looking for validation (or coming to \xe2\x80\x98ask for our attention\xe2\x80\x99).- 66 -For these participants, displaying their female body is the demanded penance for the transgression of interrupting the board\xe2\x80\x99s invisible masculinity. The process is intentionally antagonistic and coercive to participants who mark themselves as female. In one oft-shared screenshot, a 4chan participant claims that the only reason to come out as female is to \xe2\x80\x98get your girl advantage back\xe2\x80\x99 through sexual manipulation (displaying a common tendency to deny male dominance by arguing \xe2\x80\x98pretty girls\xe2\x80\x99 get whatever they want). Therefore displaying that body \xe2\x80\x98is, and should be, degrading for you, an admission that the only interesting thing about you is your naked body\xe2\x80\x99.- 67 -This tendency echoes an established problem. In Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s (2002) analysis:- 68 -\xe2\x80\xa6the gendered social context on BlueSky casts women as outsiders unless and until they prove themselves able to perform masculinities according to the social norms of the group. Women who are able to do so find acceptance within the group, but their acceptance reinscribes masculine norms, which continue to define women as assumed outsiders and outsiders, by definition, as not men. (100)- 69 -On 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/, marking gender meant marking the \xe2\x80\x98feminine\xe2\x80\x99 against a male centrality. To be an \xe2\x80\x98anon\xe2\x80\x99 (a 4chan slang label for participants in the collective, short for \xe2\x80\x98anonymous\xe2\x80\x99) was to be discursively male. To mark one\xe2\x80\x99s self as \xe2\x80\x98femanon\xe2\x80\x99 meant reifying outsider status.- 70 -Counter-intuitively, another discourse was prevalent alongside discourses of subjugation, violence, and stupidity: \xe2\x80\x98the friend zone\xe2\x80\x99. The friend zone is a forced platonic relationship. When one friend wants romance and another doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, the former is in the friend zone. Women who put \xe2\x80\x98nice guys\xe2\x80\x99 in the friend zone were accused of abuse, manipulation, and neglect. A macro called Friend Zone Fiona is premised on this perceived injustice.[5]Fiona \xe2\x80\x98loves you\xe2\x80\xa6like a brother\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98totally wants you\xe2\x80\xa6to meet the right girl someday\xe2\x80\x99, and \xe2\x80\x98invites you over\xe2\x80\xa6to fix her computer\xe2\x80\x99. The friend zone discussion was prevalent on reddit, where \xe2\x80\x98nice guys\xe2\x80\x99 would often lament their limbo status. Those in the friend zone received sympathy and, in the process, \xe2\x80\x98friend-zoning\xe2\x80\x99 girls were villainised. As with the Woman Logic macro, the woman is a prototypical \xe2\x80\x98pretty girl\xe2\x80\x99: young, thin, white, and blonde. The image juxtaposes the first clause premise and the second clause punch line to elevate hopes, and then crush them. Addressivity is commonly second person. The nice guy friend (the implied reader and addressee) is left with the scraps of the relationship.- 71 -But there were extensive pushbacks against the notion of the friend-zoned nice guy on reddit. Some contended that cross-sex friendship is itself a fulfilling state, that \xe2\x80\x98nice guys\xe2\x80\x99 aren\xe2\x80\x99t always so \xe2\x80\x98nice\xe2\x80\x99, and that niceness alone is not what keeps a relationship platonic (see fig. 10). Image memes existed that troubled broader reddit conventions, applying a logic of lulz to respond to dominant perspectives. Memetic humour and irony were tools to counter a dominant discourse.http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig64-300x251.jpg300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;Figure 10: A Matrix inspired macro that critiques friend zone logic. Its thread inspired critiques of the \xe2\x80\x98pseudo chivalry\xe2\x80\x99 that inspires guys to be friends but get mad when that friendship doesn\xe2\x80\x99t turn physical.- 72 -Another push against friend zone discourse was critical of \xe2\x80\x98guys on the internet\xe2\x80\x99 at a more fundamental and antagonistic level. In many macros, the prototypical \xe2\x80\x98internet-culture\xe2\x80\x99 participant exists in the lineage of Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s (2002) BlueSky MUD. He\xe2\x80\x99s not only a male, but a geek and a loser as well. The insult that targeted males most explicitly was \xe2\x80\x98neckbeard\xe2\x80\x99, used to conjure up familiar stereotypes about overweight, socially-awkward males (who can\xe2\x80\x99t grow facial hair anywhere except in patches on their neck, yet still try). A prototypical \xe2\x80\x98neckbeard\xe2\x80\x99 is a macro called Butthurt Dweller.[6]Butthurt Dweller \xe2\x80\x98can\xe2\x80\x99t workout\xe2\x80\xa6don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too buff\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98complains about being bullied in school\xe2\x80\xa6calls everyone a faggot online\xe2\x80\x99, and \xe2\x80\x98posts anti-religion threads on /b/\xe2\x80\xa6feels like god\xe2\x80\x99. He is overconfident, deluded about his prowess, and sophomorically arrogant. The macro employs ironic commentary to reinforce negative stereotypes about participants on reddit and 4chan.- 73 -A predominant argument was that the \xe2\x80\x98internet culture\xe2\x80\x99 male is insufficiently masculine and romantically unsure. On 4chan, participants often called those who successfully perform hetero-normative masculinity \xe2\x80\x98alphas\xe2\x80\x99 and those who don\xe2\x80\x99t for fear or awkwardness \xe2\x80\x98betas\xe2\x80\x99. Many 4chan participants explicitly identified with \xe2\x80\x98betas\xe2\x80\x99. However, \xe2\x80\x98neckbeards\xe2\x80\x99 weren\xe2\x80\x99t marked merely for being men, but for being men who deviated from dominant masculine standards. Being a woman was essentialised and universalised, being a \xe2\x80\x98neckbeard\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98beta\xe2\x80\x99 only labeled one type of inadequate masculinity. Women were discussed in blanket terms that men were not.- 74 -Still, debates over gender essentialisations did occur, even when debates became factionist. As dominant discourses butted against dissenting perspectives, discussions representative of Dahlberg\xe2\x80\x99s (2011) counterpublic model of mediated public discourse were born. In particular, pro-feminist subreddits provided participants a place \xe2\x80\x98to form counter-publics and counter-discourses; to link up with other excluded voices in developing representative, strategically effective counter-discourses; and subsequently to contest the discursive boundaries of the mainstream public sphere\xe2\x80\x99 (861). One popular subreddit was \xe2\x80\x98r/TwoXChromosomes\xe2\x80\x99, which \xe2\x80\x93 to quote its own description \xe2\x80\x93 housed \xe2\x80\x98thoughtful content \xe2\x80\x93 serious or silly \xe2\x80\x93 related to gender, and intended for women\xe2\x80\x99s perspectives\xe2\x80\x99. Its meme-focused counterpart was \xe2\x80\x98r/TrollXChromosomes\xe2\x80\x99, whose subscriber count as of early 2014 proudly stated there are at least \xe2\x80\x9847,729 girls on the internet\xe2\x80\x99. A distinct example, r/ShitRedditSays took a more actively antagonistic approach to calling out sexism on reddit.- 75 -However, as these counter-spaces adopted the logic of lulz, they were subject to its inherent tensions. Trolling behaviour still meant identity antagonism; Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law still meant ambiguities regarding stance. Nowhere was this more controversial than on r/ShitRedditSays, which embraced a lulz mentality in their discussion. r/ShitRedditSays most fundamentally catalogued identity antagonisms from other subreddits, curating what it called a \xe2\x80\x98museum of poop\xe2\x80\x99. Posts to r/ShitRedditSays most often quoted comments from other subreddits deemed hegemonic, noted the number of upvotes the comment received, and then mocked the comment. Sidebar rules discouraged explicitly refuting the offending comment in its original subreddit, admonishing that readers \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t touch the poop\xe2\x80\x99.- 76 -r/ShitRedditSays was ripe with self-referential assessments of the subreddit made by its own participants; and Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law came with these assessments. For instance, figure nine could be said to either flaunt antagonistic exclusion in the subreddit or to satirise the subreddit\xe2\x80\x99s reputation for such antagonism. It was common practice to upvote and mock submissions to r/ShitRedditSays ostensibly made by a male complaining about r/ShitRedditSays. Speculations on Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law were also common during these posts.http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig76-300x240.png300w" sizes="(max-width: 937px) 100vw, 937px" /&gt;Figure 11: An image housed at the bottom of the r/ShitRedditSays front page. It portrays innocent redditors (fans of \xe2\x80\x98funny joeks, post-*ism, logic, reason, and Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99) being assaulted with dildos by members of the subreddit. The flying band is stealing reddit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98internet points\xe2\x80\x99. r/ShitRedditSays is often accused of being a \xe2\x80\x98downvote brigade\xe2\x80\x99 which mobilises its members to \xe2\x80\x98bury\xe2\x80\x99 offending posts with downvotes after they\xe2\x80\x99re linked in the subreddit. Because of the alleged transgression, the reddit alien weeps over the death of free speech.- 77 -The broader reddit population (and r/MensRights in particular) often accused r/ShitRedditSays participants of contributing nothing to productive public discourse, but instead being as hegemonic as the patriarchal forces they supposedly resist. After all, one of the sidebar rules for the subreddit read:- 78 -RULE X: SRS is a circlejack and interrupting the circlejack is an easy way to get banned. For instance, commenters are not allowed to say \xe2\x80\x98This post is not offensive\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98This is not SRS worthy.\xe2\x80\x99 Instead, if you do not know why the shitpost was submitted to SRS, get the fuck out.- 79 -The explicitly stated aim of r/ShitRedditSays is a \xe2\x80\x98circlejack\xe2\x80\x99 where participants answer gender antagonism on reddit with their own antagonism, mocking more than discussing. The moderator post introducing the sidebar rule change expressed frustration with so many questions about why something belonged in r/ShitRedditSays and argued that \xe2\x80\x98we are not a debate club\xe2\x80\x99. The logic of lulz was employed contrary to rational discourse.- 80 -r/ShitRedditSays might be considered counterproductive to agonistic public discourse for its disregard for more rational public debate. However, Peter Dahlgren (2013) sees value in more expansive engagements between counterpublics:- 81 -Adherence to what we might characterize as a \xe2\x80\x98straightjacket\xe2\x80\x99 of rational speech for the civic subject thus undermines the potential richness and vibrancy of political discussion in favour of an illusory deal, and is likely to deflect civic engagement rather than enhance it. This is not least true in the age of Web 2.0, with all its possibilities for creative expression. (75)- 82 -Perhaps r/ShitRedditSays says wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a space for rational debate, but it was a space for participants to employ the logic of lulz to counter dominant discourses on reddit as a whole. Morris, borrowing from Michel de Certeau (1984), labels reappropriations of banal hegemonies \xe2\x80\x98the arts of making do\xe2\x80\x99. Working within the lingua franca that predominated the broader reddit, participants on r/ShitRedditSays made do with what they had, critiquing from within.- 83 -This counter, of course, assumes that participants on r/ShitRedditSays were themselves being earnest in their posts and comments. The role of r/ShitRedditSays as a \xe2\x80\x98troll\xe2\x80\x99 subreddit was contested on the broader site. In a thread on the subreddit \xe2\x80\x98r/BestOf\xe2\x80\x99 accusing r/ShitRedditSays of being a downvote brigade, one poster commented that \xe2\x80\x98my take is that SRS is full of people who think they\xe2\x80\x99re complete trolls, but don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count as trolling if you actually believe the things you say\xe2\x80\x99. The next poster speculated that participants on r/ShitRedditSays really didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe anything they posted, and \xe2\x80\x98if that\xe2\x80\x99s true, they may well be some of the best trolls reddit\xe2\x80\x99s seen\xe2\x80\x99. A third exhibited further confusion: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think even THEY know any more if they\xe2\x80\x99re joking or they\xe2\x80\x99re not\xe2\x80\x99. Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law haunted the discourse of r/ShitRedditSays, even as it contested gender antagonisms on the broader site.- 84 -Just like discourses on race, discourses on gender were problematic in their dominant antagonism. But nonmasculine perspectives were present, vocal, and antagonised back. In these arguments, multiple participants expressed multiple views utilising the logic of lulz \xe2\x80\x93 mischief, irony, and disruption \xe2\x80\x93 in their critiques. We\xe2\x80\x99re left with questions on whether this engagement was closer to adversarial agonism or to the antagonism of enemies, and the shadow of Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law looms large. However, counterpublics engaged on gender issues extensively and vibrantly.Hacking the Social- 85 -A 4chan participant, in a common 4chan practice, once described /b/ via annotated image (fig. 12). The comment was on the fierce and dirty process behind the memes that spread beyond the site. The pretty flower is the result of Morris\xe2\x80\x99 ([1988] 2007) banal \xe2\x80\x98grit and hardness\xe2\x80\x99, the cultural work of the rawest core of mediated cultural participation. Before Facebook or Twitter, before reddit even, memes are violently forged deep within in the antagonisms of 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/. Before the rest of the mediated public engages with the newest ironic artifact, established social dynamics have been hacked and exploited in the name of lulz.http://twentytwo.fibreculturejournal.org/files/2014/02/FCJ-156fig77-300x166.jpg300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /&gt;Figure 12: An annotated and photoshopped image posted to 4chan\xe2\x80\x99s /b/. The image tells a story about the participatory practices that birth memes. So the story goes, by the time \xe2\x80\x98the internet\xe2\x80\x99 gets a meme, /b/ has gone through hell to make it.- 86 -The logic of lulz is vital to 4chan, and to reddit as well. It is core to the grammar and tone of the lingua franca shared by mediated cultural participants. The Violentacrez debate spawned serious attention and serious controversy; r/Creepshots was shut down with Chen\xe2\x80\x99s expos\xc3\xa9 in October 2012, but the trolls and the lulz have not gone away. Instead, as of early 2014, \xe2\x80\x98r/CandidFashionPolice\xe2\x80\x99 is a 17,000-subscriber subreddit. It began in November 2012 and posts the same content as r/Creepshots. However the creepshots are now veneered with titles like \xe2\x80\x98gurl those are some ugly shorts\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98dayuum, look at dat fabulous dress\xe2\x80\x99. The subreddit \xe2\x80\x93 labeled as a forum where \xe2\x80\x99people post candid photos of women and then we judge their fashion choices similar to TLC\xe2\x80\x99s what not to wear and E!\xe2\x80\x98s FashionPolice\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 is serious objectification in an ironic frame. It\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the identity antagonisms left in trolling\xe2\x80\x99s wake.- 87 -When looking at race and gender representations on 4chan and reddit, we\xe2\x80\x99re left with a pair of lessons. First, as Phillips (2012) argues, trolling can be a communicative tool applied to diverse ends. It can be used to support regression and exclusion, or progression and agonism. Trolling is banal on 4chan and reddit. Morris ([1988] 2007) says it is the \xe2\x80\x98common place\xe2\x80\x99 birthed out of social practice. The prevalence of the ironic frame means a linga franca of contestation, one that can both broaden and limit voice.- 88 -The logic of lulz \xe2\x80\x93 in all the essential identity categories it antagonises \xe2\x80\x93 does not operate in the narrowly rational realm. However, neither do members of the public. As Dahlgren (2013) argues:- 89 -\xe2\x80\xa6the version of the civic self that is most coherent is precisely the one where rationality and affect, reason and emotion, are in constant interplay. The life of democracy requires that people be informed, and that they discuss and deliberate, but also that they be emotionally engaged, aroused to involvement, and at some point made to feel that they are sufficiently empowered to make a difference. (76)- 90 -This empowerment is essential for the logic of lulz to work well. Lulz must be coupled with polyvocality. Publics need counterpublics; trolls need countertrolls. Participants on r/MensRights and r/ShitRedditSays might each label themselves as \xe2\x80\x98counter\xe2\x80\x99 and their opponents as \xe2\x80\x98hegemony\xe2\x80\x99. Arguments are sharpened and refined when points clash. One-sided trolling means the logic of lulz is served for exclusion rather than voice. Trolling \xe2\x80\x93 at its best \xe2\x80\x93 may not be narrowly rational, but it can be a way to stir issues that are often left invisible in more narrow or polite discussion. Even if the relations are between enemies instead of adversaries, contestation is more vibrant than repression. Exclusion is always more antagonistic than voice.- 91 -Second, however, the logic of lulz \xe2\x80\x93 that hyper-humorous, hyper-ironic, hyper-distanced mode of discourse \xe2\x80\x93 can cause tensions by the ambiguity of its stance. The real challenge for public discourse in participatory collectives may not narrowly be disembodiment or affect, but Poe\xe2\x80\x99s Law. As Shifman (2013) argues, even when we can easily read content and form, stance has more subtle dimensions. Tone and intent are hard to read, as they were when Lange (2006) argued for the difficulties in labelling a \xe2\x80\x98true\xe2\x80\x99 flame. Irony markers can be employed ceaselessly to a multitude of ends. The problem is not with the \xe2\x80\x98lean\xe2\x80\x99 medium (4chan and reddit are capable of vibrant and robust multimodal communication); the problem is the ironic norms foundational to the logic of lulz. \xe2\x80\x98Only joking\xe2\x80\x99 can be used to \xe2\x80\x98whitewash\xe2\x80\x99 exclusion and silence countering perspectives, online or off. Adversarial levity can be a benefit, but a lack of earnest engagement \xe2\x80\x93 conflicted or otherwise \xe2\x80\x93undermines those benefits.- 92 -In an environment of banal antagonism, participants made do with what they had. They hacked social dynamics so extensively that trolling itself became an expected norm. While repressive and abusive trolling \xe2\x80\x93 the kind attributed to Violentacrez \xe2\x80\x93 is antagonistic and counterproductive to public discourse, the practice can have its productive, agonistic dimensions as well. However, this awareness shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude acknowledging the very real inequalities that persist. As Morris ([1988] 2007) argues:- 93 -Cultural studies is a humane and optimistic discourse, trying to derive its values from materials and conditions already available to people. On the other hand, it can become an apologetic \xe2\x80\x98yes but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 discourse that most often proceeds from admitting class, racial, and sexual oppressions to finding the inevitable saving grace. (130).- 94 -Trolling wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a saving grace. The logic of lulz facilitated old inequalities. But the social dynamics hacked by that logic could be hacked to diverse ends. With enough voices engaging and enough of a balance between irony and earnestness, the logic of lulz could be a tool vibrantly employed.Biographical note- 95 -Ryan M. Milneris an Assistant Professor of Communication at the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC, USA. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Kansas in 2012.
